I have with me members of the FBI team who have taken a lead\nrole in this investigation. The FBI has opened a '7A' - that's a missing\npersons file - and has assigned Zoey Patricia Bartlet a control number:\n7A WF 83429. The 'WF' stands for 'Washington Field Office'. I'll take a few\nquestions before turning it over to Agent Casper. Mark?\n\nMARK\nHow long will Speaker Walken be President?\n\nC.J.\nUntil President Bartlet sends a second letter to Congress indicating he's\nprepared to resume his duties. Steve?\n\nSTEVE\nCNN is reporting the Fifth Fleet has been ordered into the Persian Gulf. Is\nthere any reason to believe this might be the work of a foreign government?\n\nC.J.\nWe're still in the early stages of this; it's to early to speculate who's\ninvolved. Chris?\n\nCHRIS\nParamedics on the scene have indicated drugs were involved. Does Zoey Bartlet\nhave a drug problem, and did she have any reason to disappear?\n\nC.J.\nThere's a Secret Service Agent with a bullet in her head. I think the FBI\nfeels pretty comfortable in calling it a kidnapping.\n\nCHRIS\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nAnd no, Chris, Zoey Bartlet doesn't have a drug problem. Agent Casper.\n\nREPORTERS\nAgent Casper! Agent Casper!\n\nCASPER\nAt 3:17 am, we received what we believe to be an authentic communication from\nMs. Bartlet's kidnappers demanding the release of three convicted terrorists\nbeing held by Pakistan and the immediate removal of all American forces from\nQumar and Saudi Arabia. We're also issueing a BOLO for five individuals last\nseen in the Portland area who are wanted for questioning in connection with\npossible terrorist activities.

Even FOX is treating it as a seminar on\nthe resiliency of the Constitution.\n\nJOSH\nThe President's daughter is probably tied up in the back of a gas station. We\nhave no idea how this is playing.\n\nWILL\nHe showed he's a leader, nobly embracing his own flawed humanity.\n\nJOSH\nLincoln and Kennedy had children who died. They didn't take a sabbatical.\n\nTOBY\nWho's been calling?\n\nJOSH\nCongressional leadership.\n\nTOBY\nLincoln never got a ransom note from Jefferson Davis. He's putting country\nbefore family. I'd carpet bomb Mecca to get my kids back.\n\nJOSH\nWhat if they like Walken better? What if he seems more presidential? What\nif they want Walken to stay?\n\nWILL\nIn a few days, President Bartlet turns the second letter over to Congress.\n\nJOSH\nWhat if it doesn't take a few days?

Three days.\n\nDANNY\nIn exchange for an exclusive on five Bahji sleepers the FBI just outed to\nevery news outlet in the known universe.

Good morning, Mr. President.\n\nWalken sits.\n\nWALKEN\nStand down, everybody.\n\nThey all sit.\n\nWALKEN\nWhere are we?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe Washington carrier group will be in position in three hours.\n\nWALKEN\nHave we had any further communication from the kidnappers?\n\nCASPER\nNo. But the driver's license used to rent the minivan from the Kinko's\nled us to an apartment complex in Baltimore rented to the same Shahab\nKaleel. Neighbors say two Arab men were living with Kaleel. No one's seen\nthem for three days.\n\nLEO\nWhat about the apartment?\n\nCASPER\nMail, photographs, numerous fingerprints, even a passport.\n\nWALKEN\nThey didn't try to cover their tracks?\n\nCASPER\nNo, sir. They don't care if we know who they are. They don't plan on being\nalive in a few days.\n\nWALKEN\nWhat do you want to hit, Admiral?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nKazir training camps.\n\nNANCY\nThe Qumaris say those are religious schools.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThere terrorist training camps masquerading as religious schools. We traced\nKaleel to Zachari Faruk, leader of the camps.\n\nWALKEN\nThey close to anything?\n\nNANCY\nVillages, hospitals, a food distribution center.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWe're suggesting AGM-88 HARMS. We'll hit what we're aiming for.\n\nNANCY\nThis is a long-term ally in a highly volatile region.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nBombing Tripoli stopped Libya.\n\nNANCY\nIt's more likely to strengthen the resolve of the terrorists and topple a\nmoderate Islamic regime.\n\nLEO\nIf we bomb the camps, don't the kidnappers murder Zoey Bartlet?\n\nWALKEN\nOr it sends a message: kill her or don't, the United States does not negotiate\nwith terrorists.\n\nSLATTERY\nOur European allies are going to go crazy. They have billions tied up in\noil and natural gas pipelines in Qumar.\n\nWALKEN\nScrew the Europeans. They've had years to get the Qumaris to get their house\nin order. What are the chances Zoey Bartlet's still alive?\n\nCASPER\nHard to say. But I think yes, she probably is. They'll want to milk this\nfor all it's worth.\n\nWALKEN\n[standing up] Get your people in place, Admiral. We don't go today unless we're\nprovoked. Find Zoey Bartlet and find her fast, but so help me, if she turns\nup dead, I'm going to blow the hell out of something and God only knows what.\n\nHe leaves as Nancy and others stare at him in disbelief.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. - ELEVATOR - WHITE HOUSE\n      HOUR NINE\n\nLeo is inside the elevator.

Jean Paul thought he was spiking her drink with Ecstasy,\nnot GHB.\n\nABBEY\nAnything else from the kidnappers?\n\nLEO\nNot yet. But the FBI has traced a driver's license to an apartment in\nBaltimore. They have names and descriptions of two other suspects and a\nwealth of information to work off of.\n\nIn the background, a phone starts ringing.\n\nBARTLET\nWe need to stall and give the FBI more time.\n\nLEO\n[nodding] Yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're already doing it.\n\nLeo nods.

She just\nends up consoling them.\n\nLEO\nEveryone's calling. 22 heads of state, the Queen, the Vatican.\n\nBARTLET\nI guess people aren't excited about the idea of our children being in play\nnow. They gave her a number, Leo. I saw it on CNN. My little girl's a case\nnumber now. Five digits.\n\nLEO\nDanny Concannon is going to run the Shareef story.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nLEO\nThe Shareef story. Danny's running it. Asked if we wanted to comment on it.\n\nABBEY\n[into phone] But we all have to believe it's going to be all right.\n\nBARTLET\nNo. No comment.

I had it with the NEC week-ahead. Now I can't even\nfind that.\n\nMargaret leans over, picks something up from his desk, and hands it to\nhim.

[to Will]\nI've got some VP names.\n\nWILL\nGreat.\n\nWill's hair is ruffled and Josh points it out to him. He tries to straighten\nit as they continue talking.\n\nJOSH\nHayes.\n\nTOBY\nFair Labor Standards Act?\n\nJOSH\nYeah. Graham?\n\nWILL\nNo support in the Northeast. Plus he rides that scooter which is a little...\n\nJOSH\nSheats?\n\nTOBY\nToo...\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nWILL\nYou getting a lot of calls?\n\nJOSH\nOnly a couple of hundred. They all start out by saying how sorry they are\nabout Zoey and then spend ten minutes trying to work their name and the vice\npresidency in into the same sentence.\n\nDonna walks in and hands a jacket to Josh.\n\nDONNA\nLeo's looking for you. [to Toby] Are they going home today?\n\nTOBY\nWho?\n\nDONNA\nThe twins.\n\nJOSH\nI was gonna ask about the twins.\n\nTOBY\nThey go home tomorrow.\n\nJOSH\nAnyone else coming to the Auto Da Fe?\n\nTOBY\nWe weren't invited.\n\nDonna, seeing Will's hair, begins to smile.\n\nWILL\nWhat?\n\nLEO [prelap]\nPresident Walken has assured me that he has no intention...\n\nCUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\n\nLeo is meeting with the Democratic leadership.\n\nLEO [cont.]\n...of pushing any partisan agenda.\n\nWOMAN\nWalken can spend his entire presidency channel surfing in the Lincoln\nBedroom. You said to the country, Democrats can't handle security.\n\nMAN #1\nIf you want to save a spotted owl, vote Democratic. If you want your kid\nsaved, sorry, we'll be doing the crossword.\n\nLEO\nPresident Bartlet is protecting kids by ensuring that decisions are made\nbased on relevant intel, not on a distraught father's clouded emotions.\n\nWOMAN\nIf any emotions are clouded, Leo, its yours. Let's face it, Leo. You've\nalways been too close to Bartlet.\n\nMAN #2\nIt's your job to buck him up, Leo. To help him make the tough decisions. The\npresidency isn't a vanity exercise.\n\nLEO\nWho's doing electoral math on the back of a napkin in the middle of a\nnational crisis?\n\nWOMAN\nYou single-handedly ended the Imperial Presidency.\n\nMAN #1\nYou've elevated Walken and the Republicans. You've made them into genuine\nplayers on the world stage.\n\nLEO\nI didn't elevate them. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 did. And I'm\nnot prepared to think about politics while we're under terrorist attack. The\nRepublic comes first. That's why Truman wanted the Speaker third in line.\n\nWOMAN\nTruman wanted the Speaker third in line because he used to drink bourbon\nwith Sam Rayburn.\n\nLEO\nThe only thing I find extraordinary about that is that a member of\nthe executive branch actually wanted to share a drink with a member of\nCongressional leadership. [standing up] Thank you for coming by to show your\nconcerns. And I'll be sure to pass them on to President Bartlet.\n\nHe walks out of the room and into his office. Josh follows.\n\nJOSH\nThose guys are on our side? They're not wrong, you know. We should be thinking\nabout the political ramifications. We should be polling on this.\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nThe Republicans will.\n\nLEO\nNo!\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\n Josh leaves the office.\n\nLEO\n[pause] Margaret.\n\nMargaret steps into the office.\n\nLEO\nGet me Angela Blake.\n\nMARGARET\nIn New York?\n\nLeo nods his head.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nC.J.

While she is, Walken\nand his staff walk up the other hall, also going to the press room.\n\nWALKEN\nBack home, you have to pay extra for that at the Kit Kat Club.\n\nC.J.\nI got something on my skirt.\n\nWALKEN\nThey ready for us?\n\nC.J.\n Yeah.\n\nCAROL [OS]\nI'll go settle the room. [she leaves]\n\nWALKEN\nMy tie straight?\n\nC.J.\nNo. Would you like me to...?\n\nWALKEN\n[nodding] Thanks.\n\nC.J. sets her stuff down and begins to straighten Walken's tie.\n\nWALKEN\nRemarkable how that Post story hit the wires right before we released it.\n\nC.J. continues straightening his tie without looking him in the face.\n\nWALKEN\nBad luck for us, I guess.\n\nC.J.\nThere you go.\n\nWALKEN\nYou know I'm not the enemy. The things that unite us are far greater than\nthings that divide us. We both believe in democracy, preservation of American\nvalues, protection of our citizens in a sometimes hostile world.\n\nC.J.\nLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness?\n\nWALKEN\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nThat's what's in your statement?\n\nWALKEN\nSomething like that.\n\nC.J.\nDon't look down at the front row when you answer questions.

Good answer.\n\nREPORTER #4 [on TV]\nYou stated that as Speaker, you knew of and supported the assassination.

Are you going to nominate a Vice President?\n\nWALKEN\nInsuring an orderly succession is important, but right now, all of us here\nare just focused on getting Zoey Bartlet back for her parents and for the\nnation. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nHe steps away from the podium and offscreen as Bartlet turns of the TV. Liz\ncomes into the room.\n\nLIZ\nDad?\n\nHe doesn't answer.

I'm here. I don't remember that.\n\nBARTLET\nIt was a difficult decision!\n\nABBEY\nMade by you, not us.\n\nThe girls are obviously tense about the argument that's going on.\n\nBARTLET\nI did what I thought was necessary.\n\nAbbey comes around from the table she was at and leaves the room with\nher lunch.\n\nABBEY\nYour decisions, Jed, not ours.\n\nLiz leaves the room behind her mother.

And we're following it up with ground forces to detain and interrogate\nany suspected terrorists.\n\nUSEF\nThank you for informing us in such a timely manner.

Can you hang on for one sec?\n\nHe bends down, puts the phone on the table, and puts his shoes on. He sits,\nup, rubs his eyes, and then runs his hands through his hair several times. He\npicks the phone up again.\n\nJOSH\nHey...No really, I already went for a run.\n\nHe gets up and opens the door and we see Amy Gardner standing in front of\nthe door talking on her cell phone, obviously to Josh.\n\nAMY\n[into phone] Nice track suit.\n\nThey both hang up as she comes inside.\n\nAMY\nCould have said I woke you.

We have a new Speaker.\n\nShe shows him the paper. The Headline reads \"HAFFLEY SEIZES THE HOUSE\".\n\nJOSH\nOh, God, Haffley? He'll be passing out pelts and slabs of bison in the\ncloakroom.\n\nAMY\nRoll Call has the GOP leadership resuming its committee schedule tomorrow\nwhether Zoey's back or not.\n\nJOSH\nAside from adding to our nation's greenhouse gas problem those committee\nhearings are meaningless.\n\nAMY\nWord on the street is, Atwood has Walken meeting with Republicans today\nwithout any Democrats.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, they were over last night, too.\n\nABBEY\nWere any of you there? Well they weren't talking site selection for the\nRepublican National Convention.\n\nJOSH\nDamn it, Haffley?\n\nAMY\nThey're gonna start legislating again, Josh. Partial birth, federal funding\nfor family planning clinics...\n\nJOSH\nWalken does anything by executive order, we overturn it as soon as we get back.\n\nAMY\nA cheering thought to the women who's lives are ruined in the meantime. Do\nyou even know when you'll be back?\n\nJOSH\nNot exactly. Damn it.\n\nAMY\nIf Walken's holding partisan pep rallies in the West Wing, leak it.\n\nHer beeper starts going off.

See if Leo's around, would you?\n\nJosh walks into his office and sees his new intern, RYAN PIERCE, sitting in\na chair in front of his desk.\n\nJOSH\nHi.\n\nRYAN PIERCE\nHi.\n\nJosh looks at him for a minute and then walks back out. Donna is dialing\nher phone.\n\nJOSH\nThere's that guy in my office.\n\nDONNA\nThat's Ryan. Says he works for you. Did you forget to tell me something?\n\nJOSH\nHe said he works for me?\n\nDONNA\nThat's what his pass says, too.\n\nJosh walks back into his office. He shakes Ryan's hand as he comes around\nhis desk.\n\nJOSH\nHi. Josh Lyman.\n\nRYAN\nRyan Pierce. I didn't know if I should come in, what with everything that's\ngoing on.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, it's been pretty crazy here.\n\nRYAN\nI figured if there was a problem, somebody would have called or...\n\nJOSH\n\nOkay, who are you?\n\nRYAN\nRyan Pierce.\n\nJOSH\nRight, no, I got that part.

He begins\nmonologue-ing to Toby, who stares at him while he does.\n\nJOSH\nWord is, the Republicans are coming back over today. Is Leo invited? Are\nyou? I think they're planning to start legislating. Partial birth, school\nvouchers, maybe even Anwar. They've got the votes on the Hill, the only\nreason they haven't moved on Medicare again is because they know we'd veto.\n\nTOBY\nDid you get any sleep last night?\n\nWill walks in.\n\nWILL\nHaffley. Can you believe it?\n\nTOBY\nWe can filibuster in the Senate.\n\nJOSH\nNot on partial birth or tax cuts.\n\nWILL\nWhat are we talking about?\n\nJOSH\nGetting our asses kicked.\n\nTOBY\nYou going to Leo? Wait for me.\n\nAs he's walking out of his office, he hands Will a writing pad.\n\nTOBY\nWill you read this. I'll be right back, okay?\n\nJOSH\nA once-in-a-lifetime chance to slam dunk your agenda and solidify your\nbase? Plus, Walken's going to ride off into the sunset as the presumptive\nRepublican nominee. You think Atwood wouldn't love to cinch that with\npartial birth?\n\nThey walk through the Roosevelt Room and into Margaret's office.\n\nTOBY\nThree new Supreme Court Justices? A few new weapons systems?\n\nJOSH\nAh, I'm not being paranoid.

Pick issues where\nwe can't sustain a filibuster and ram 'em through.\n\nLEO\nThey won't.\n\nJOSH\nThey're meeting secretly again to today.\n\nLEO\nIt wasn't secret yesterday. They were in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nJOSH\nTo plot a strategy.\n\nLEO\nThis isn't the grassy knoll, Josh. Walken isn't going to take the offer...\n\nJOSH\nYou've asked him?\n\nLEO\n[to Toby] You been drinking his Kool-Aid?\n\nJOSH\nWe need to leak it to the press. The GOP are using the cover of a national\ncrisis to impose a radical right-wing agenda.\n\nLeo turns to walk back to his desk.\n\nLEO\nJosh...\n\nJOSH\nThe President needs to sign the second letter and take his office back. Then\nwe nominate a strong VP. Once he's confirmed, if the President still needs\nto recuse himself, he can step aside.\n\nLEO\nGo through all this again?\n\nJOSH\nPlease, we should at least take it to the pre...\n\nLeo has obviously had it listening to Josh ramble on.\n\nLEO\nDamn it, Josh!

There's a guy in my office, says he works for me,\nknows you. Ryan...\n\nLEO\nRyan Pierce, right. He's your new intern.\n\nJOSH\nI thought we decided I wasn't going to have to have interns anymore?\n\nLEO\nNo, you decided.\n\nMargaret walks to the door and waits to speak to Leo.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. Pierce is...? Is he a Pierce Pierce?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nJosh turns and leaves the office.\n\nMARGARET\nThey're ready for you.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nLeo heads out of his office and Toby goes with.

Now we have to live with it.\n\nTOBY\nThey're bombing Qumar?\n\nLEO\nWe're bombing Qumar. How are you and Will coming on the speeches?\n\nTOBY\nWe've started working.\n\nLEO\nThe second one, for if Zoey doesn't...I don't want the President to know I\never asked you to...\n\nTOBY\nYeah. No, of course. Hell, if I could even figure out how to write it.

He looks over at the TV.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's that?\n\nWILL\nCongress.\n\nTOBY\nWhat are they doing outside?\n\nWILL\nPraying for Zoey.\n\nTOBY\nSo...what?\n\nWill reads from the pad he has been writing on.\n\nWILL\n[reading] 'Today we affirm this solemn truth, America is the strongest\nforce for freedom the world has ever kno...' So strong, you can trigger a\nconstitutional crisis by dosing the First Daughter's vodka gimlet.\n\nTOBY\nGive it back.\n\nWILL\n'Anyone who dares invade the sanctity of America's house will be caught,\nprosecuted, and punished with all of America's might.' Meaning what,\nexactly? We're going to bomb their prison cells? You're treating Zoey like\nan abstraction. It needs to be a man, humbly supplicating himself...\n\nTOBY\nSupplicating? He's not going to stand in front of the cameras and rub\ngravel through his hair. We need a tone of defiant leadership, a return to\nCommander-in-Chief. What's the alternative? Admitting he was off licking\nhis wounds, but now he's ready to come back and take the nuclear launch codes?\n\nWill hands him the paper he has been writing on.\n\nWILL\nI was just trying a few...\n\nToby takes it and looks at it.\n\nTOBY\n[reading] 'I thank the Lord that Zoey is back in her mother's arms, yet our\nnation still grieves.'\n\nWILL\nWell, it's a new and difficult time. He needs to acknowledge that we've all\nbeen visited by our own mortality.\n\nTOBY\n'I know I am not alone in think how fragile is the safety and security\nwe all take for granted.' Your leading with failure. What kind of message\nis that?

Reduction in discretionary spending. You have something\non your mind, Leo?\n\nLEO\nSo, now what?\n\nWALKEN\nYou have a suggestion?\n\nLEO\nThis office isn't always about doing something.

Of\ncourse, a more accurate description of that period of time would be \"Till\nPresident Bartlet signs the second letter and boots Walken's fat ass out of\nour White House.\"\n\nSTEVE\nWhat the hell are you going on about?\n\nJOSH\nYou're campaigning in the middle of a national tragedy. Zoey Bartlet's out\nin the field, breathing through a straw; you're test driving sound bites\nfor the next election? Straight answer, Steve, once in your life. What are\nyou guys up to? Closed-door meetings, planting quotes in the Times... What's\nnext? Spontaneous speeches on the House floor questioning President Bartlet's\nfitness to lead?\n\nSTEVE\nYou don't get it, do you? Republicans are in awe of Bartlet. He recused\nhimself in the only way he could. In the way envisioned by the Constitution.\n\nJOSH\nNone of the framers were afraid of the President's daughter being kidnapped\nat musket-point.\n\nSTEVE\nThe whole notion of the 25th Amendment is that the institution matters more\nthan the man. Bartlet's decision was even more self-sacrificing because he\nwillingly gave power to his opposition.\n\nJOSH\nThe institution may matter more, but it's your guy protecting it, not ours.\n\nSTEVE\nA truly self-sacrificing act usually involves some sacrifice.\n\nJOSH\nSo now you're goin to nail us to the cross?\n\nSTEVE\nNo. You beat the terrorists at their own game. We're not stupid, Josh. We\ntry to use this to our advantage, it'll blow up in our faces. We'd seem\ncallous and unfeeling, in contrast to Bartlet's extraordinary gesture of\ncourage and patriotism. And anyone who thinks otherwise, has a particularly\ncraven way of looking at politics.\n\nHe walks out of the restroom, leaving Josh alone. Josh leaves the restroom,\nand when he does he finds people hurrying through the hallways. He runs\naround the corner and into C.J.'s office. C.J., Carol, and two other people\nare in there watching the TV.\n\n JOSH\nWhat happened?\n\nC.J.\nAl Jazeera has a tape of Zoey.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nWalken, Leo, Casper, and a translator are standing around the TV watching\nthe broadcast.\n\nCASPER\nThey first broadcast it four minutes ago.\n\nWALKEN\nWhat's he saying?\n\nTRANSLATOR\nHe's claiming responsibility for the kidnapping, in the name of the Bahji\nand Solomon de Mahmoud.\n\nWALKEN\nWho is that?\n\nCASPER\nOne of the terrorists they want released from prison in Pakistan.\n\nWALKEN\nWhat-what is that she's holding?\n\nCASPER\nThis morning's USA Today.\n\nTRANSLATOR\nThey are again demanding the prisoners in Pakistan be released.\n\nWALKEN\nIs she even conscious? She looks drugged.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWhy is the quality so bad?\n\nCASPER\nWe think it's a digital photograph, e-mailed to al Jazeera, probably over\na modem.\n\nWALKEN\nWe're sure that's her?\n\nLEO\nIt's her. What else is he saying?\n\nTRANSLATOR\nHe is denouncing the United States, The Kingdom of Qumar, and our attack on\nholy Moslem lands. And he says that if every American soldier is not out of\nQumar in 24 hours, they are going to shoot her.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\n      TUESDAY 1:30 AM\n      HOUR 50\n\nCUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\n\nBartlet is walking through the hall of the White House. He has several Secret\nService Agents accompanying him. He walks past the Communications bullpen\nwindow and sees Toby walk into his office. He walks into the Communications\nbullpen and into Toby's office. A man seated a desk out side Toby's office\nstands when he sees the President. Toby is just about to sit down when\nBartlet walks in.\n\nBARTLET\nToby.\n\nToby stands back up.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.\n\nTOBY\nNo, no, sir. I'm just surprised to see you down here, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThey haven't revoked my pass yet. Please, sit.\n\nToby does.\n\nTOBY\nIs there anything I can do for you, sir, anything?\n\nBARTLET\nDo you have a cigarette? Abbey doesn't let me smoke in the Residence. I\nusually keep a pack hidden in the office.\n\nTOBY\nI probably have a couple of cigars.\n\nHe gets up to get them.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, thanks. I just thought somebody on your staff...\n\nHe walks around the room looking at different stuff.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat are you working on?\n\nTOBY\nThe speech for when you come back.\n\nBARTLET\nHow's it coming?\n\nTOBY\nFine. Tough.\n\nBARTLET\nMind if I have a look?\n\nToby hands him the pad. Bartlet begins reading it.\n\nTOBY\nIt's not finished yet.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's fine.\n\nTOBY\nI'm still working on the ending.\n\nBartlet continues to read the speech.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere's the other one?\n\nTOBY\nWhat other one?\n\nBARTLET\nThe other speech.\n\nTOBY\nWe only wrote one.\n\nBartlet stares at Toby for a second before Toby grabs the other speech off\nof his desk and hands it to Bartlet. Bartlet takes it and begins reading it.\n\nBARTLET\nYou write this?\n\nTOBY\nNo. Will.\n\nBartlet becomes teary-eyed as he reads the speech.\n\nBARTLET\n[reading] 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away...' You mind if I take\nthis with me?\n\nToby shakes his head.\n\nBARTLET\nMaybe I can bum a smoke off one of the agents.\n\nBartlet turns and begins to leave.\n\nTOBY\nYou take care of yourself, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - FBI COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT\n\nWe see several people at work and on phones. We focus on one woman in\nparticular. She is on the phone. As she is on the phone, she gets a look of\nconcern on her face.\n\nWOMAN\nCan you hang on, officer?\n\nShe puts the phone on her desk and gets up. She walks through a door and\ninto the hallway. She walks around the corner into another office where\nAgent Casper and another man are bent over a table looking at something.\n\nWOMAN\nExcuse me, sir. We may have something.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\nLeo and Admiral Fitzwallace are talking.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYou been home since this thing started?\n\nLEO\nI'm all right.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYou guys any closer to naming my successor?\n\nLEO\nYou were serious about that? I thought you were joking.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nI promised Laura a month on a boat, kicking around the Caribbean for our\nhoneymoon. 32 years later, I think her patience is starting to finally\nwearing a bit thin.\n\nLEO\nYou sail?\n\nABBEY phone on the table starts ringing. Someone answers it as Fitzwallace\nand Leo keep talking.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe last thing I captained weighed 7,000 tons. I should be able to figure\nout how to slip a 32-foot Catalina into a slip in Kingston.\n\nOFFICER\n[into phone] Yes, sir. Mr. McGarry is here. Yes, sir. [hanging up] Mr. McGarry,\nsir. Admiral, the FBI ares on their way over. They think they found Zoey\nBartlet.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MARINE ONE HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nMarine One is flying above some trees with its light on. Abbey, Bartlet,\nLiz, Ellie, Leo, Charlie, and Agent Casper are inside. Casper is briefing\nthe President. He can barely be heard above the roar of the helicopter.\n\nCASPER\nA Virginia state Trooper responded to a domestic disturbance call outside of\nCalverton. They both got drunk. He had let her out by the side of the road in\nthe middle of nowhere, so she called 911 on her cell. The trooper couldn't find\nher. She had wandered off somewhere to try to get out of the rain. Guy checked\nan old barn across the road from where she said she'd be. A white van...\n\nThe chopper lands and the steps are lowered. They all hurry out, down the\nsteps, and start across the field where they have landed. Many cars are\nparked in the field and many agents as well as local police are standing\naround talking. They are led over to an ambulance where Zoey is sitting in\nthe back. Abbey runs over to her.\n\nABBEY\nZoey!\n\nWe see Leo and Agent Casper talking to another agent.\n\nAGENT\nShe's got a possible clavicle fracture, some irritation because of the tear\ngas, and some ringing in her ears because of the flashbangs. No sign of sexual\nassault, but she's still a bit out of it. They're going to run a tox screen...\n\nLEO\nThey all dead?\n\nAGENT\nSharpshooters got two using the spike-mike and thermal scanners. The other\none was sleeping when we came in. Tried to grab a weapon. We found her locked\nin a closet in the back bedroom.\n\nSomeone calls for Agent Casper. Leo is left alone looking thoughtful.\n\nWe see Bartlet looking emotional and teary-eyed.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\nFADE IN: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - WALKWAY - DAY\n\nWe see Bartlet, dressed in a full suit, walking down the walkway. Josh and\nToby are following behind him. They walk into the Oval Office where Leo,\nSteve Atwood, President Walken, C.J., and Will are waiting. Bartlet walks\nover behind the President's desk to speak to Walken.\n\nBARTLET\nMr. President.\n\nWALKEN\nGood morning, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou ready to do this?\n\nWALKEN\nYes, sir.\n\nLeo comes over to the desk and gives Bartlet a piece of paper. Bartlet takes\nit and signs it. He hands the pen to Walken and then shakes his hand.\n\nBARTLET\nYou going to run again?\n\nWALKEN\nI haven't decided.\n\nBARTLET\nIf you do, let me know. I'll come campaign for you.\n\nWALKEN\nI'm not so sure that'd be a plus in my district, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYou stick around for the press conference?\n\nWALKEN\nThank you, sir, but I think the nation's best served by seeing only one\nPresident at a time.\n\nWalken turns to leave. Steve leaves in front of him. As he leaves, Walken\nshakes Leo's hand.\n\nBARTLET\nGlen?\n\nWalken turns around.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nWalken nods his head proudly and walks out of the office.\n\nTOBY\nI have the final version of your speech for your review, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nI won't need it. I'm going to use the one from last night.\n\nHe pulls the speech out of his inside coat pocket.\n\nTOBY\nLast night, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI made a few changes, Will. I hope you won't mind.\n\nWILL\nNo, sir. Of course not.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you, everyone.\n\nEveryone except Leo turns to leave.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nJOSH\nThank you, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHow much time do we have C.J?\n\nC.J.\nThey're gathering now. We told the networks to be ready in ten minutes. Excuse\nme, sir. Will the First Lady be joining you?\n\nBARTLET\nNo. She's at Walter Reed with Zoey.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nShe turns, leaves, and closes the door on her way out. Bartlet hands Leo\nthe piece of paper that he signed. Leo puts it in a blue folder.\n\nLEO\nWould you like us to get that up on the TelePrompTer for you, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nNo. That won't be necessary.\n\nLeo turns and leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nJosh is sitting at his desk. The bulletin board now has only five pictures\non it, with a picture of Lewis Berryhill in the center. Josh gets up, walks\nover to the board, and takes off one of the pictures. Steve Atwood walks to\nhis door.\n\nSTEVE\nSo, who's the lucky winner?\n\nJOSH\nThe President hasn't decided.\n\nSTEVE\nYou got a favorite?\n\nJOSH\nPresident hasn't decided.\n\nDonna walks up to the door.\n\nDONNA\nJosh, they're gathering.\n\nDonna leaves.\n\nSTEVE\nNice office.\n\nHe smiles and leaves. Josh lays the picture down on his desk and walks out of\nthe office and over to where Donna is standing. She looks at him and nods. He\nwalks through the door as we hear the newscaster on the TV announcing the\nPresident's speech.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nThe senior staff is waiting along with Leo to walk with Bartlet out into\nthe Rose Garden.\n\nWILL\nDid we ever find those five Bahji sleepers?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBartlet comes out of the office and puts his speech paper into his inside\ncoat pocket.\n\nLEO\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nAre they ready for us, C.J.?\n\nShe nods. Bartlet indicates that he is ready, and she goes leaves.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere are we on the Vice President?\n\nLEO\nWe have several candidates, ready for your decision.\n\nWe hear C.J. announcing the President.\n\n\nC.J. [OS]\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.\n\nBartlet exits through the same door C.J. exited and walks down the walkway\ntoward the Rose Garden. The rest of the senior staff follows him. We hear\nBartlet begin the speech.\n\nBARTLET [OS]\n'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.'\n\nCUT TO: INT. - ZOEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS\n\nZoey is lying in bed. Charlie, Liz, Doug, and Ellie are sitting around her\nbed watching Bartlet's speech. Abbey is standing at the window.\n\nBARTLET [on TV]\nWords I did not fully understand until our daughter was taken from us three\ndays ago. But now we can rejoice and be glad, for that which was lost has\nbeen found. That my child is back in her mother's arms is serendipity and\ngrace; a second chance that will not slip through our hands again. I wish I\ncould tell you there's some new policy, some new weapons system - a silver\nbullet, perhaps - that could meet this moment; that could keep us safe from\nthe terror that's now among us. But if I were to say that, I'd be lying. All\nI can promise is that I will fight with every fiber of my being, every weapon\nin our our arsenal, and with every ounce of God's grace...\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\n\nBARTLET [VO][cont.]\n...to keep us strong and free and safe.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END.\n* * *\n\nEpisode 5.02 \"The Dogs of War\" Original Air Date 1 October, 2003.\n</pre>"},

They are talking as\nthey walk towards Leo's office.\n\nJOSH\nThat wasn't the worst. The worst was the M-80s at the ballpark.\n\nLEO\nMm-hmm.\n\nJOSH\nMe and Tommy Ledden and the other guys pulled our ammo and, in a burst of\npatriotic pride, blew out the toilets behind the concession stand. Cute\ngirls were there, in shorts.\n\nThey have come into Leo's office. Margaret comes in from her office.\n\nMARGARET\nIs the Secretary of State supposed to be here?\n\nLEO\nYeah. Is he? It was set last night.

Get me someone from the Counsel's Office, Legislative\nAffairs...\n\nJOSH\nBerryhill's already been through this as Secretary.\n\nTOBY\nHe was confirmed by the Senate, not by the House.

I showered. I wanted to ask, though, on the assassination...\n\nTOBY\nAvoid that word, for starters.\n\nC.J.\nBirardi's letter keeps it on the front page.

First Lady pissed?\n\nAMY\nShe's her... her attention is elsewhere.\n\nJOSH\nThat's probably good.\n\nAMY\nYeah, not really.\n\nJOSH\nShe'd get worked up. I doubt she could do a whole lot about it.\n\nAMY\nShe could do plenty.\n\nJOSH\nThen it's a damn shame.\n\nAMY\nThere's a future for you in motivational speaking.\n\nJOSH\nSo, take it to her.

I didn't mean that.\n\nAMY\nYou absolutely meant that.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, maybe I did.\n\nAMY\nCareful what you start.\n\nShe walks away.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nWe see C.J. answering some questions on the TV.\n\nKATIE [on TV]\n... that the most practical reason for not engaging in the assassination of\nforeign leaders is that our own officials and their families are vulnerable\nto retaliation.\n\nC.J. [on TV]\nAbdul Shareef was not targeted as a foreign leader. He was stopped as a\nterrorist from blowing up the Golden Gate Bridge. We should wrap up here\nbecause Zoey Bartlet will be coming down soon and those of you in the pool\nwill want to get in position. If I can remind you, this young lady had been\nthrough an ordeal. She's not going to take questions, so if you could show\nsome basic human... you know, I almost said decency, but don't worry, I'm back.\n\nWe pan into the Oval Office where Bartlet is meeting with several people\nincluding Leo, Ron Butterfield, an unnamed General, and an unnamed FBI agent.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's next?\n\nGENERAL\nNorfolk is remaining at ThreatCon 5. The training manuals confiscated in\nPortland included blueprints for a radiological dispersion device and the guys\nwe detained in Tanzania yesterday were packing Botchelinum toxin and cyanide.\n\nBARTLET\nBut we can go ahead and light some sparklers in our own backyard?\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nAlong with our people, the FBI, the Park Service, Capitol and local police,\nthere'll be an extra 2,000 officers out.\n\nFBI AGENT\nAnd the Air Force has jets monitoring the airspace and there's a no-boating\nzone enforced on the Potomac between 14th street and the Memorial Bridge.\n\nBARTLET\nAn invitation to party if I ever heard one.\n\nLEO\nVery few local events have been effected.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat has?\n\nFBI AGENT\nA reading of the Declaration of Independence at the National Archives got\npostponed because no one had cleared the fife and drum corps. And an overflow\ngroup of immigrants taking their citizenship oath had to cancel. The VFW\nhall they're using had a bomb scare.\n\nBARTLET\nFine. Thank you all.\n\nThey all get up and leave. Bartlet walks over to his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen do I sit down with Berryhill?\n\nLEO\n2:00.\n\nBARTLET\nGood. I've got a lunch I don't want to rush.\n\nLEO\nHow's Zoey doing?\n\nBARTLET\nReally well, considering.\n\nCHARLIE\nThey're on their way down.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks.\n\nCharlie shuts the door.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's with this bomb scare at an immigration ceremony?\n\nLEO\nImmigration has been encouraging more district and neighborhood\nceremonies. Most of this group being sworn in are from Arab countries.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're talking folks who have been interviewed and background-checked by two\nagencies, taking classes to learn our language, passed exams on our history\nand government, and been fingerprinted twice; these are the kinds of Arabs\nwe're talking about?\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's find them an auditorium where they can safely take their oath.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBartlet leaves the office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\nWe see that Debbie has a large stack of papers at her desk.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, man, I don't like the looks of all that.\n\nDEBBIE\nThey call it nonessential for a reason, Mr. President.\n\nCHARLIE\nWe'll send most of it down to the Auto-Pen.\n\nBARTLET\nThe Auto-Pen couldn't do its thing while I was on hiatus?\n\nDEBBIE\nIt raised some Constitutional issues we couldn't parse.\n\nShe has a laminated photo in her hand that she has a question about.\n\nDEBBIE\nHere. C.J. needed you to approve this. It's from the archives. She said\neveryone will probably go with the firework shot, but this one is nice. It's\nsweet.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo it's not, they were laughing at me.\n\nBARTLET\nWas this your first time up at the farm? It was, wasn't it?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, I got on and I stayed on.\n\nDebbie's phone starts ringing.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're a natural horseman, Charlie.\n\nDEBBIE\nUh, Fiderer. ... Thank you.\n\nShe hangs the phone up.\n\nDEBBIE\nShe's ready.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - SOUTH LAWN - PORCH - DAY\n\nWe see that Abbey, Zoey, and C.J. are ready, waiting to do the press\nconference. Bartlet walks up.\n\nBARTLET\nAre you...\n\nABBEY\nUh...\n\nZOEY\nMom, I'm okay.\n\nBartlet takes Zoey by the arm and leads her. C.J. follows them. Abbey leans\nagainst a pillar.\n\nC.J.\nReady? You know how to do this. Just breathe and walk. You look great.\n\nC.J. stops at the edge of the porch and Bartlet and Zoey continue on. They\nare walking along a pathway. There are a lot of reporters and photographers on\nthe other side of a rope. Suddenly, Zoey stops and waves to the crowd. Bartlet\nfollows suit.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\n\nLeo, Josh and Toby are meeting with members of the Republican Leadership,\nincluding Speaker of the House Haffley and Senate Majority Leader Royce.\n\nLEO\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Leader, in the spirit of \"Everyone wins,\" we wanted first\nto thank all of you and the Republican leadership. We can feel proud of how\nwe criss-crossed the aisle in recent days. And second, we'd like to inform\nyou of the President's choice for Vice President.\n\nROYCE\nSo, there's nothing to the rumor that he begged Walken to stay?\n\nJOSH\nThey're just good friends.\n\nLEO\nIt's going to be Lewis Berryhill. He'll step down as Secretary of State.\n\nROYCE\nWell, we've already confirmed him once. You're looking for an expedited\nprocess?\n\nTOBY\nThe country needs to move on.\n\nROYCE\nHe's an obvious choice: his military records, governmental service.\n\nHAFFLEY\nFrankly, I've got a problem.\n\nJOSH\nWhat kind of problem?\n\nHAFFLEY\nI don't have the votes. Not for Berryhill.\n\nJOSH\nThe guy's a war hero. He's the most popular Secretary of State since... whoever\nLincoln had. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHAFFLEY\nSeward. Lincoln had Seward, who was stabbed in his bed, and Berryhill wasn't\nconfirmed by the House.\n\nJOSH\nNo one's confirmed by the House. This is your one at bat.\n\nLEO\nWe should let them have the room.\n\nHAFFLEY\nLeo, no, I don't need to be schooled by my Senate brethren. I get what my\njob is.\n\nJOSH\nAdvice and consent, that's your job. Confirm the President's choice as\nqualified.\n\nTOBY\nNo one can say that Lewis Berryhill isn't qualified.\n\nHAFFLEY\nBut you don't want a fight. Berryhill's a fight.\n\nLEO\nMr. Speaker, I know you haven't been through this before...\n\nHAFFLEY\nNone of us has. Other administrations haven't lost their Vice President to\na sex scandal.\n\nROYCE\nMr. Speaker.\n\nHAFFLEY\nDon't misunderstand me. I'm not here just to be a naysayer. I have suggestions.\n\nJOSH\nYou have suggestions?\n\nHAFFLEY\nHere are a few names that could be easily confirmed.\n\nHe pulls a slip of paper out of his inside jacket pocket and slides it to\nLeo. Leo looks at it and then shows it to Josh.\n\nJOSH\nThis is your list?\n\nHaffley nods his head. They show the paper to Toby.\n\nROYCE\nDo you mind?\n\nToby hands the paper to Royce.\n\nLEO\nSenator?\n\nROYCE\nI have no problem with this list.\n\nHaffley takes the paper from him and slides it back across the table.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE.\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. - HALLWAY - DAY\n\nLeo, Toby, and Josh are walking away from the Roosevelt Room.\n\nJOSH\nWhat the hell just...\n\nAs they walk by the Communications Office, Leo calls out to Will.\n\nLEO\nWill. In the Oval, and grab C.J.\n\nJOSH\nWe just... we got tagged.\n\nThey walk into the Outer Oval Office.\n\nJOSH\nIdiot thinks he tagged us.\n\nTOBY\nHe did.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nBartlet is meeting with Leo, Josh, Toby, C.J., and Will.\n\nJOSH\nHe's bluffing.\n\nWILL\nWe don't blink.\n\nLEO\nWhat the hell is he thinking? Is he just in over his head?\n\nJOSH\nHe's an idiot. And he's bluffing.\n\nWILL\nWe put up Berryhill and we wait for the Republicans to self-destruct.\n\nC.J.\nIf we have the time.\n\nJOSH\nHe's an idiot, he's bluffing, and we're going to destroy him.\n\nLEO\nYou worried about it leaking or are you worried about our numbers?\n\nC.J.\nBoth. How long can we spin this so our numbers hold? If it drags on and gets\nugly and people have time to worry...\n\nTOBY\nWe've got a fight; with this list it's a joke. August Adar would bore the\ncountry into a stupor and Starkey is, forgive me, sir, more likely to keel\nover in the next three years than you are.\n\nJOSH\nThat's what Haffley's counting on. The longer he drags this out, the longer\nhe's next in line.\n\nWILL\nDiane Frost is a serious name.\n\nJOSH\nDiane is a serious loon of the left.\n\nTOBY\nI love Diane Frost. I'd marry Diane Frost if I were a member of her stated\nsexual preference, but Diane is the definition of unelectable.\n\nJOSH\nThat's their agenda: sniper anyone who looks hard to beat next time around.\n\nC.J.\nI thought this choice wasn't about partisan politics.\n\nJOSH\nIt is now.\n\nBARTLET\nCome on, guys, the door is closed. This has always been about partisan\npolitics. One reason we were dancing on the tables this morning is because\nBerryhill looks good to take over in three years.\n\nTOBY\nHe also looks good right now.\n\nWILL\nWho is Robert Russell?\n\nJOSH\nHe's the Congressman from Western Colorado. And I don't mean the state,\nI mean the mining company.\n\nTOBY\nBob Russell is not Presidential.\n\nJOSH\nAre we actually discussing the list?\n\nC.J.\nWe're dissing the list. Wasn't Russell... is he \"Bingo Bob\"?\n\nTOBY\nThat's Russell.\n\nJOSH\nLet's not even dis the list.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, listen up. We're sticking with Berryhill. I want to announce tomorrow.\n\nLEO\nLet's check in with our friends, make sure they've got our backs.\n\nTOBY\nWhat about the list?\n\nLEO\nGet these folks in. You and Josh have some nice chats.\n\nJOSH\nYou want to placate Haffley?\n\nLEO\nI want to try. If he thinks he's getting to advise, maybe he'll consent. And\nif you could say hello, too, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHello is about all they're going to get.\n\nLEO\nWhatever happens has to happen now. Time's not our friend here, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nI'm on it.\n\nJosh leaves.\n\nLEO\nC.J., can you...?\n\nBARTLET\nToby, when's the briss?\n\nTOBY\nIt was this morning, sir.\n\nC.J.\nThis morning? You dog.\n\nTOBY\nWe've been a little busy.\n\nC.J.\nI'll get you later.\n\nBARTLET\nNice service?\n\nTOBY\nFor me. I'm not sure Huck enjoyed it as much.\n\nBARTLET\nQuite a way to start the morning.\n\nTOBY\nIt was.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd it's just the beginning.\n\nThey leave.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY\n\nJosh walks into the bullpen and comes over to Donna's desk. He hands her\nthe list.\n\nJOSH\nCall 'em in; 20 minutes apiece. Make it clear this is not about the Vice\nPresidency. They are not candidates for jobs, you know, listed in the\nConstitution.\n\nDONNA\nAre they candidates?\n\nJOSH\nThey are not. They are not. Repeat that.\n\nDONNA\nThey are not.\n\nJosh walks into his office and shuts the door.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nLeo and C.J. are talking.\n\nC.J.\nThey were becoming citizens?\n\nLEO\nBefore the bomb scare they were. Margaret's checking into other venues.\n\nMARGARET\nGW's getting back to me about a hall.\n\nC.J.\nYou want to release that the President's helping them find a site for their\nswearing in?\n\nLEO\nWait until we're sure we've solved it.\n\nThey start walking.\n\nLEO\nOn the other thing...\n\nC.J.\nI'm fine.\n\nLEO\nToby thought you were...\n\nC.J.\nToby's wrong. I'm not.\n\nLEO\nBirardi's resignation letter was persuasive.\n\nC.J.\nIt was, but I'm not... I don't know why Toby...\n\nLEO\nYou know what?\n\nHe stops.\n\nLEO\nI'm sorry, I gotta...\n\nC.J.\nSure.\n\nAs C.J. walks away we pan around to see Amy and Abbey walking into the\nbuilding.\n\nAMY\nAnd Secretary Ralph sent some beautiful calilillies.\n\nABBEY\nI'll give him a call. Anything else?\n\nAMY\nKen Crupp called, a couple of times.\n\nABBEY\nI've got his card. Thank him for me. [pause] What?\n\nAMY\nI think Ken's concerned about the HHS Appropriation. There were some changes\nin the CDC budget. The Committee's going to markup. Violence Prevention\ncould lose 65%.\n\nABBEY\nSorry, what are you...?\n\nAMY\nI'm sorry. It was nothing.\n\nABBEY\nAmy, you're going to have to handle things for me a little while longer.\n\nAMY\nI know. Do you want me to...?\n\nABBEY\nI trust you. That's why I hired you.\n\nAbbey walks off and Amy leaves in the opposite direction.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nDebbie is sitting at her desk when Abbey walks in. She stands.\n\nDEBBIE\nAh, hello. He's just finishing a call with Congresswoman Frost.\n\nABBEY\nI'm looking for my daughter.\n\nDEBBIE\nShe's meeting with Will. But, I... he... don't you... he'd want me to...\n\nABBEY\nNo, no, no. No, don't bother.\n\nDEBBIE\nUh, Mrs. Bartlet, I can't tell you how hard I prayed for you.\n\nAbbey looks as though she is genuinely touched at the sentiment.\n\nABBEY\nI appreciate that.\n\nDEBBIE\nWell, you shouldn't. I'm not very religious, so there's the risk that my\npraying could be taken as insincere or even an affront, which, if it's a\nvengeful God, could have made matters worse.\n\nABBEY\nWell, it didn't. So maybe there's a clue.\n\nAbbey turns to leave.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - DAY\n\nZoey and Charlie are sitting in front of the window and Zoey is looking at\nsome of the mail that came in while she was kidnapped.\n\nZOEY\nSo, how many of these letters have come?\n\nCHARLIE\nAt last count, 10,000.\n\nZOEY\nOh, here's another good one. \"Dear Zoey, I hope they don't kill you. But if\nthey do, then it'll be quick.\"\n\nCHARLIE\nZoe.\n\nZOEY\nShe put a little smiley face at the end.\n\nWill walks in.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou don't need to read them.\n\nZOEY\nSure I do.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, you don't.\n\nWILL\nSorry.\n\nZOEY\nNo, you're busy.\n\nWILL\nNot at all.\n\nZOEY\nOh, is it okay if Charlie stays? He thinks he needs to babysit me.\n\nWill sits down across from Zoey.\n\nWILL\nSure. How was lunch?\n\nZOEY\nYou know dad: \"Jefferson Lives.\"\n\nCHARLIE\nWill hasn't been here.\n\nZOEY\nOh, my dad loves 4th of July stuff, like Jefferson and Adams dying on the\nsame day.\n\nCHARLIE\nAdams thought Jefferson had survived him. \"Jefferson Lives\" were his last\nwords.\n\nZOEY\nIt appeals to dad; you know, hope and irony.\n\nWILL\nWith a little party politics thrown in. Shall we get busy? You want to draft\na letter, a response to the country, is that right?\n\nWill takes out a pad of paper and gets ready to write some things down.\n\nZOEY\nYes.\n\nWILL\nSo I'm going to ask you some questions and come up with a draft for you\nto review.\n\nZOEY\nOkay.\n\nWILL\nWe'll start with \"How do you feel?\".\n\nShe looks as though she is not sure.\n\nWILL\nDon't worry about phrasing or brevity, I'll do that part.\n\nZOEY\nI feel lucky. I feel happy to be back... and grateful. I feel a little bad\nthat so much had to go into this. Saving me, and all. I wish I hadn't... that\nit didn't happen.\n\nWILL\nWe all do.\n\nZOEY\nAnd that I had to go...\n\nCHARLIE\nIt wasn't fault.\n\nZOEY\nOkay, so that's good, huh?\n\nWILL\nUh-huh.\n\nZOEY\nIt wasn't...?\n\nShe stands.\n\nWILL\nThat was... yeah. I'll get back to you.\n\nZOEY\nCool. Thanks will.\nShe leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - DAY\n\nJosh and Toby are meeting with SENATOR STARKEY, regarding the VP list given\nto them by Haffley.\n\nSENATOR STARKEY\nAnd, of course, there's the necessity to lessen the ceremonial burdens.\n\nTOBY\nAbsolutely, Senator Starkey.\n\nSTARKEY\nIn ways, John Hoynes didn't...\n\nJOSH\nLet's not talk about that.\n\nSTARKEY\nI'm saying the agenda could be strengthened if more of the President's\nceremonial burden was removed.\n\nJOSH\nWe don't disagree.\n\nSTARKEY\nGood.\n\nTOBY\nDo you have a few minutes to say hello to the President?\n\nThey get up.\n\nSTARKEY\nI'm at his disposal.\n\nThey lead Senator Starkey into the hallway and shut the door behind him. Josh\nsighs, as though he is tired of the charade. Toby goes to the door that\nleads in from the Outer Oval Office and opens it. CONGRESSMAN ROBERT \"BOB\"\nRUSSELL comes in. He and Toby shake hands.\n\nTOBY\nCongressman Russell.\n\nCONGRESSMAN ROBERT \"BOB\" RUSSELL\nMr. Ziegler.\n\nHe walks over to shake Josh's hand.\n\nRUSSELL\nMr. Lyman.\n\nJOSH\nJosh. We met at the...\n\nRUSSELL\nGood memory. I wasn't sure you could pick me out of a crowd.\n\nJOSH\nLuckily, I didn't have to, Bob. We'd like to establish from the outset you\ncan imagine what the press climate is around here and why we can't afford to,\nwell, make decisions before we've made them.\n\nRUSSELL\nSure.\n\nTOBY\nThere's to be no discussion whatsoever in this meeting of any position in\nthe federal government that may or may not be open.\n\nRUSSELL\nUnderstood.\n\nJOSH\nWhich is not to say this meeting is about that.\n\nRUSSELL\nOkay.\n\nTOBY\nWhat are your thoughts on the President's and the Party's agenda for the\nnext three years?\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nBartlet is sitting with Berryhill and they are talking.\n\nBARTLET\nThere hasn't been much about the last couple of weeks that I wouldn't\nrather erase, but this I'll keep. Lewis, I'm hoping to announce you as my\nnew Vice President.\n\nBERRYHILL\nOur new Speaker balking?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. This could be rockier than we had hoped.\n\nBERRYHILL\nI can handle it.\n\nBARTLET\nNot just for us, but for the country.\n\nBERRYHILL\nSir, as Secretary of State I've shown you my conciliatory side. But in my\nheart of hearts I'm spoiling for a fight.\n\nBARTLET\nMe, too.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - DAY\n\nAbbey is sitting down with Ron Butterfield. They are discussing Zoey's Secret\nService detail.\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nWe're going to double her detail; visible presence, in diamond formation,\nflanking her just like we do the President.\n\nABBEY\nNo more running out for yogurt?\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nWe need three days advance notice for site sweeps and background checks on\nanyone she may come in contact with.\n\nABBEY\nI'm going to need a little time to process this.\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nOf course.\n\nThey stand.\n\nABBEY\nI do have one question.\n\nWe hear a knock at the door. Leo walks in.\n\nLEO\nSorry, I didn't hear this was moved up.\n\nABBEY\nWe're just finishing.\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nThere'll be a written report on the new protocols on your desk by COB.\n\nLEO\nGreat.\n\nABBEY\nFeel free to copy Leo, but I'd like the report delivered to me directly, Ron.\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nFine.\n\nRon turns to leave but then turns around.\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nDid you have a question? You were saying you had a question.\n\nABBEY\nHow would you compare the Residence with the Farm?\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nIn terms of security?\n\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nLEO\nWhat are you thinking...?\n\nABBEY\nI don't know yet. Ron?\n\nBUTTERFIELD\nWell, as you're aware we have the farm continually secured. It doesn't have\nbulletproof windows or a crash-proof gate. Here, we're in a fortress. On\nthe other hand, the White House is a target; ground-zero. It's probably 6-to-1.\n\nABBEY\nThank you.\n\nRon leaves. Leo sits down.\n\nLEO\nI hadn't heard you were thinking about New Hampshire. That might be the best...\n\nABBEY\nI moved the meeting up because I didn't want you here.\n\nLEO\nIn the meeting?\n\nABBEY\nIn the Residence.\n\nLEO\nYeah. I've been trying to... I thought... you need some space.\n\nABBEY\nShe's back. She's safe. She's going to stay safe.\n\nLEO\nWe all want what's best for Zoey.\n\nABBEY\nYou laid us open. You laid me and my daughters wide open. And God knows what\nelse there is that I don't know about.\n\nLEO\nThere is nothing else.\n\nABBEY\nI swear to God, Leo, don't... 72 hours; the bruises aren't even... did you\nsee her face? For God's sake, don't ask me to trust you.\n\nLEO\nI'm not.\n\nABBEY\nAnd don't think you took the bullet. I blame Jed.

He's a popular Secretary. But he runs State like\na dictator.\n\nTOBY\nCome on.\n\nWENDALL\nI know, I'm overstating, but many Democrats see Berryhill as aloof.\n\nSHEILA\nAnd not only because he's never run for office, not even dogcatcher. He's\nnot a team player. A minor flaw, maybe, but you're anointing the guy.\n\nWENDALL\nAnd once he's in the spotlight...\n\nSHEILA\nEspecially if he's stuck in the spotlight while the Speaker grinds the\ngovernment to a halt.\n\nTOBY\nSo, you think Berryhill's warts are going to start to show?\n\nJOSH\nYou're assuming the Republicans are going to follow through. Haffley's list\nof candidates was amateur hour.\n\nWENDALL\nThere are some decent names on that list.\n\nSHEILA\nIf you insist on Berryhill we'll go to the mat. But it'll only prove how\nimpotent you've made up.\n\nTOBY\nHow's that?\n\nSHEILA\nYou guys knighted Haffley when you moved Walken out. Haffley's not\nbluffing. Haffley doesn't bluff.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. So, we fight for Berryhill. We only need a majority; four guys to\nbreak ranks and join with you. It's that simple.\n\nSHEILA\nHaffley knows he's got 'em on choke chains. And you won't get them; not in\na day, not in a month. It's that simple.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nBartlet is meeting with SENATOR ADAR. Adar is talking about Jefferson and\nAdams, and his tone is nothing if not monotonous.\n\nSENATOR ADAR\nSo, there he was, on his deathbed, 50 years to the day, 50 years since\nthe signing of the Declaration, July 4th, Independence Day. There he is,\non his deathbed...\n\nBARTLET\nWhich one are you with now, Senator Adar? Jefferson?\n\nADAR\nAdams. But of course both of them were dying on the same 4th of July, that's\nwhat's so amazing.\n\nBARTLET\nAhh.\n\nADAR\n50 years since that day in Independence Hall, immortalized in Trumball's famous\npainting of the scene. Two great giants dying on their country's birthday,\nafter years of friendship and feuding. [pause] As diplomats in Paris...\n\nBARTLET\nExcuse me. I'm sorry, Senator.\n\nHe gets up and heads toward the door.\n\nBARTLET\nThis will only take a second.\n\nHe walks into the Outer Oval Office and over to Debbie's desk.\n\nBARTLET\nDebbie, you were supposed to interrupt after five minutes.\n\nDEBBIE\nIt's only been three, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nTell Leo I can't take any more of these.\n\nDEBBIE\nThere's only a couple more.\n\nBartlet stops at the door and takes a deep breath before going in.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nJosh, Toby and Will walk into Josh's office.\n\nWILL\nWait, the Democrats actually like the list?\n\nJOSH\nThey aren't wild about Berryhill.

Just get me Leo.\n\nRYAN\nUh, Leo McGarry?\n\nJOSH\nYes, Leo McGarry.\n\nC.J. comes to the door and bumps into Ryan as she is coming into the office.\n\nC.J.\nThey leaked the list; the Starkey Russell list.\n\nWILL\nIs that bad? It makes Berryhill look even better.\n\nTOBY\nGuys, we can't confirm Berryhill.\n\nC.J.\nWe can't?\n\nWILL\nWe're having trouble with the Democrats.\n\nC.J.\nWow. Along with the Republicans, that's kind of everyone.\n\nTOBY\nWe've got to move on.\n\nJOSH\nMove on? We don't move on from our first post-Walken showdown. This is the\nsingle, most defining decision the President makes.\n\nTOBY\nNo kidding. And time's running out and if we don't find someone they'll\nconfirm by tomorrow...\n\nC.J.\nWe had other names.\n\nRyan comes back in.\n\nRYAN\nHey, uh, sorry.

She was fearless with the press.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir. She does that.\n\nWe see a flash, in which Zoey is riding the horse from Bartlet's dream. The\nhorse jumps over a low fence.\n\nBARTLET\nYou've said this before.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - MANCHESTER FARM - FLASHBACK - DAY\n\nBartlet, Charlie, and Abbey are standing along the side of the fence, and\nthey are watching Zoey ride the horse.\n\nBARTLET\nLook at that. Fearless.\n\nCHARLIE\nShe puts up a good front.\n\nBARTLET\nName one thing, one thing, my little girl's afraid of.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nCharlie is talking to Bartlet.\n\nCHARLIE\nShe knows you like to see her strong. She thinks what happened was her fault.\n\nWe see another flash of the horse now running faster and Zoey trying to\nstay on.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm sorry, sir, but...\n\nBARTLET\nHer mother wants to take her back to New Hampshire for a while. What do\nyou think?\n\nCHARLIE\nI think her momma's right.\n\nBARTLET\nHmm.\n\nCharlie leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nJosh is sitting at his desk writing on a pad of paper. We see that the\nbulletin board is back with at least three pictures on it, one of which is\nBerryhill. Josh looks upset as though he has failed. Amy comes in and starts\ntalking really fast and she is excited about what she has gotten accomplished.\n\nAMY\nI just got off the phone. I need you to call Dule. I know it isn't at the\ntop of your to-do list, but I've got the Chairman on-board if he has a little\ncover which Dule will agree to if you ask...\n\nJOSH\nAmy...\n\nAMY\nI know, I know; smallpox and anthrax were front and center but we spent\nyears getting violence recognized as a health threat...\n\nJOSH\nYou've got to stop.\n\nAMY [cont.]\n... and if women and children aren't safe in their own homes, who needs\nnational security.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, I'm begging you, stop. S-stop talking... y-you're a machine; my head's\ngoing to explode.\n\nAMY\nYou said if I got the First Lady...\n\nJOSH\nWe don't have a Vice President! Get it? That's our first thing and I can't\nget it done. I can't get Berryhill confirmed. The one guy the President wants,\nand-and I can't get it done. So, could you, just... be quiet for one moment?\n\nAMY\nSorry. B-Berryhill's perfect.\n\nJOSH\nI-I mean it, one minute, in silence. Can you manage that?\n\nAMY\nBut, I...\n\nJOSH\nYou can't do it, can you?\n\nJosh stands.\n\nAMY\nYou...\n\nJOSH\nSee?\n\nShe looks at her watch. We see her take her shoes off and she sits on the\nwindowsill. Josh comes back and sits down at his desk. He notices that Amy\nhas her feet propped up on his desk. He laughs when he sees that she has\nher watch out and she is watching the seconds. He gets up and walks over to\nher. He takes the watch from her and then bends down to kiss her. After they\nkiss, she gets her shoes and walks out the door.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nBartlet is seated while Zoey is packing some things into a suitcase.\n\nZOEY\nI can't believe you're doing this.\n\nBARTLET\nWe talked about going up to the farm for a long time.\n\nZOEY\nLater on, all together.\n\nAbbey walks in.\n\nZOEY\nYou guys just ganged up on me.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's right. Your mother and I are a united front, so don't bother.\n\nAbbey looks at him and says nothing. Bartlet gets up to help her pack.\n\nBARTLET\nCome on, this is going to be good. You'll have the orchard to walk in. Once\nthat shoulder heals, you'll have Quince to ride. I'll be up as soon as I\ncan. There's only one thing you have to do for me: give yourself time. Don't\ntry to rush this.\n\nAbbey has been standing at the edge of the room listening to the\nconversation. She leaves.\n\nZOEY\nThere was an arm... grabbing me. When I start to fall asleep, it comes back.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're going to help you. We're all going to help.\n\nHe continues to help her pack her things.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE.\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nBartlet and Leo come in from the portico. They are talking about Berryhill.\n\nBARTLET\nSo the question now is how big a battle is Berryhill worth.\n\nLEO\nThat sums it up, sir.\n\nDebbie knocks and comes in.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's eager for it, by the way.\n\nLEO\nBerryhill?\n\nBARTLET\nToo eager, maybe.\n\nDEBBIE\nCongressman Russell is here, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWho?\n\nDEBBIE [whispering]\n\"Bingo Bob.\"\n\nCUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nToby and C.J. are looking at baby pictures.\n\nC.J. [laughing]\nLook at that. Oh, my God.\n\nTOBY\nHe looks a little pissed in that one.\n\nC.J.\nYou look kind of...\n\nTOBY\nYeah, he hates me already.\n\nC.J.\nAnd Molly.\n\nTOBY\nWell, her brother got a Hebrew name so she had to have one.\n\nC.J.\nWhere's Andy? Was she even there?\n\nTOBY\nYou gonna step out for the fireworks.\n\nC.J.\nI don't know. I may go home.\n\nTOBY\nYou should. You've been going all at it without a break.\n\nC.J.\nI'm okay.\n\nTOBY\nI went over the briefings from the last few days. There weren't many questions\nabout the covert operation.\n\nC.J.\nThere were questions.\n\nTOBY\nWhy didn't Shareef have a trial or a tribunal? Who asked that?\n\nC.J.\nThey're my questions, Toby. I'm asking. You read Birardi's\nresignation? \"Violence is the last resort of civilized nations. Violence\nwrapped in secrecy is the choice of thugs.\"\n\nTOBY\nYou think we're thugs?\n\nC.J.\nI don't know.\n\nTOBY\nYou want to keep talking?\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\nC.J.\nHuh-uh.\n\nTOBY\nLet me know.\n\nHe leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\nBartlet is seated and talking with Congressman Russell.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm glad you were able to stop by.\n\nRUSSELL\nI wouldn't miss a chance to discuss the party's agenda, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWe can toss out the script. The list is out there now.\n\nRUSSELL\nGreat. [pause] Great we can talk directly, not great that the list was leaked.\n\nBARTLET\nWere you surprised to find your name on that list, Robert?\n\nRUSSELL\nIt's Bob. Robert's my dad. And, uh, yes, sir, I never thought I'd be sitting\nhere today.\n\nBARTLET\nThis place is full of surprises.\n\nRUSSELL\nIf this is a courtesy to the Speaker, I won't waste your time with a long\npitch.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, please.\n\nRUSSELL\nI get along with people. They like me in the House because I don't ruffle\nfeathers, and they like me back home because I honestly enjoy a good rubber\nchicken. Something to do with the cooking I grew up on. And it may look like\nI'm awful cozy with the mining industry, but West Co. employs five times as\nmany of my constituents as anyone else in my district.\n\nBARTLET\nAre you a horseman, Bob? I'm looking at your boots.\n\nRUSSELL\nOh, I love to ride. You?\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\nBARTLET\nMy youngest daughter is the one with the talent.\n\nRUSSELL\nPraise the good Lord for her safe return.\n\nBARTLET\nWe do.\n\nRUSSELL\nNo, I wear these boots, um... oh, I could give you some crap about remembering\nmy roots, but I wear these because I have flat feet and they don't hurt\nmy arches.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, thank you for coming by on such short notice.\n\nThey stand.\n\nRUSSELL\nUh, let me go on the record. If you were to offer the job, I would be honored.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nRUSSELL\nBut I would need a couple of things.\n\nBARTLET\nOh?\n\nRUSSELL\nI wasn't close enough to say for sure about your relationship with John\nHoynes, but as your Vice President I would want more access.\n\nBARTLET\nUh-huh.\n\nRUSSELL\nDirect access; weekly lunch, drinks; especially since we don't know each other.\n\nBARTLET\nSounds like you'd be a Vice President who'd be looking to move up.\n\nRUSSELL\nI'm not trying to run out the clock on you, but I'm sure that my name\ncame up because some see me as the bland candidate, nobody's nightmare,\nthe triumph of mediocrity. If I were to take the job, I'd mean to confound\nthose expectations. And I want you to know that.\n\nBARTLET\nAny other ways I can sweeten the offer for you, Bob?\n\nCUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - EVENING\n\nLeo is seated, watching TV, when Bartlet knocks and enters.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sending my girls home.\n\nLEO\nI heard.\n\nBARTLET\nYou want to say goodbye?\n\nLEO\nAbbey and I spoke earlier.\n\nBartlet indicates for Leo to sit. He does, and Bartlet comes to sit by him.\n\nBARTLET\n227 years ago, a bunch of guys got together on the 4th of July and decided,\nbecause they didn't have any cherry bombs, they would declare some self-evident\ntruths.\n\nLEO\nFed up with democracy, are we?\n\nBARTLET\nI called Lewis Berryhill. I told him it wasn't going to work out.\n\nLEO\nYou didn't want to fight?\n\nBARTLET\nI did want to fight but the country needs a President who's doing their\nwork, and since they put their trust in a guy whose mortality is showing,\nthey deserve a chain of command that's irrefutable.\n\nLEO\nSo who is it?\n\nBARTLET\nBen Franklin thought the only hope for democracy was if people respected\neach other enough to compromise. The folks in  Western Colorado had four\nchances to change their mind about Bob Russell and they haven't.\n\nLEO\nBob Russell? Really?\n\nBARTLET\nHe ain't my choice, but hey, we hated the last guy, so let's start the\nvetting process.\n\nLEO\nYou want to tell the gang?\n\nBARTLET\nYou do it. I'm done for the day.\n\nLEO\nActually, Mr. President, you have one more thing.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - AUDITORIUM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY\n\nA large group of Arab people are assembled to take their oath of citizenship.

Please...\n\nThey all sit.\n\nBARTLET\nMy fellow Americans, congratulations and welcome. I hear you had some trouble\nfinding a safe place to take your oath today. Our Founding Fathers were in\na similar predicament. In many ways our great Declaration of Independence\nwas a work order issued under fire. One we still struggle to fulfill. Now,\nif you'll please stand, place your hand over your heart, and say with me...\n\nThe group begins to recite the pledge.\n\nGROUP\nI pledge allegiance...\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT\n\nAbbey and Zoey are getting into a limo and they're getting ready to\nleave. Charlie is there to see them off. We can still hear the group reciting\nthe pledge.\n\nGROUP [cont.]\n... to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which\nit stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nWe open on a shot of several magnificent fireworks going off in the sky\nagainst the backdrop of the Washington Monument. We see Josh and Ryan at\nthe buffet getting several glasses of champagne. They bring them over to\nwhere Donna, Toby, Will, and Amy are standing. They watch the fireworks\nfor several moments, and then Josh looks down to where Amy is standing. She\nlooks back at him. She then decides to leave. She walks away. Josh turns to\nsee her leave and follows her.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nWe see C.J. sitting at her desk. She is staring out the window, thinking. We\nsee the fireworks lighting up the room.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - TRUMAN BALCONY - NIGHT\n\nBartlet is on his balcony, and he is watching the fireworks.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - LIMO - NIGHT\n\nAbbey and Zoey are riding along. Zoey has her down in her mother's lap.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nToby, Will, Ryan, and Donna are watching the fireworks when Leo comes up to\nstand between Will and Toby. He speaks in Toby's ear and then in Will's.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - TRUMAN BALCONY - NIGHT\n\nBartlet is watching the fireworks.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - MANCHESTER FARM - FLASHBACK - DAY\n\nWe see the horse that Zoey is riding is moving fast and is about to buck Zoey\noff. She holds on and stays on. We next see Bartlet helping her off the horse.\n\nYOUNG ZOEY\nI wasn't scared, Daddy. It was fun.\n\nWe see a shot from the walk that afternoon.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - LIMO - NIGHT\n\nZoey has her head in Abbey's lap.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - TRUMAN BALCONY - NIGHT\n\nBartlet is thinking as he watches the fireworks.

President\nBartlet is inside with pianist Jai Yung Ahn and two North Korean officials.\n\nBARTLET\n[his words being simultaneously translated into Korean] Yeah, I took lessons\nfor six years - hopeless. No sense of time - I could read okay and get the\nfingering down, but I should have been sent to rhythm prison.

I really don't have\nto call it that do I?\n\nLEO\nOf course not.\n\nBARTLET\nFor keeping us out of er... thing.\n\nADVISOR 2\nWe do nothing. The tech bubble lead to overinvestment, this is a normal\ncorrection.\n\nADVISOR 1\nWe don't know that.\n\nADVISOR 2\nBubbles burst, that's why they're called bubbles.\n\nTOBY\nExplain that to the 1.2 million people who've just lost their jobs.\n\nJOSH\nPhone 'em, they're home.\n\nADVISOR 2\nThe Fed does its thing; a reduction of 25 basis points stops the bleeding.\n\nADVISOR 1\nWe can't leave this to the Fed; it'll look like we're asleep at the switch.\n\nLARRY\nA stimulus package?\n\nADVISOR 2\nYeah, let's increase the deficit; that's responsible.\n\nADVISOR 1\nSomething temporary; a one year increase in the standard deduction.\n\nBARTLET\nWhich helps not at all the bottom 40% of wage earners who don't pay income\ntax. We have to stop or I'm gonna start shooting people, starting with\nmyself. I asked for a recommendation, not a debate. Wake me when there's\na consensus.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nJOSH\nThank you, sir.\n\nLEO\nWhat's the matter with you guys? The man's got a Nobel in this.

Thanks for coming. What do we think?\n\nBARROW\nYou don't blow a negotiation of this magnitude over some kid. I don't care\nif he plays Schubert with his feet.\n\nMIKE\nIt violates international law.\n\nADVISOR\nUS law.\n\nLEO\nOne thing at a time. The negotiations - they for real?\n\nBARROW\n[nods] And we're not just talking about another freeze. Hundreds more sensors\ninstalled, inspectors on the ground in (place in North Korea not identifiable).\n\nLEO\nThey've broken agreements before, what's different now?\n\nBARROW\nThe Chinese. They're worried that the North's nuclear programme will push\nJapan into finally developing the bomb. The Koreans screw around this time,\nthey piss off the only ally they have left.\n\nLEO\nThis is that serious they're gonna blow it over some piano player?\n\nBARROW\nIt's the most unpredictable regime in the world. Walking out on the\nnegotiations could be the least thing they do.\n\nLEO\nThey'd shell Seoul over this?\n\nBARROW\nYou wanna find out?\n\nA knock on the door, C.J. enters.\n\nMIKE\nSwell and lovely, but we can't send him back. Listen very carefully - it's\nagainst the law.\n\nADVISOR\nTitle 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits sending an alien\nback to his homeland if he has well-founded fear of being persecuted there.\n\nBARROW\nPersecuted? He's the most privileged guy in the entire country.\n\nADVISOR\nAnd since the penalty for attempted defection is death, that may just change.\n\nBARROW\nHe's only in jeopardy if the Koreans find out. Are you gonna tell them?\n\nLEO?\nAny straws in the wind?\n\nC.J.\nAll quiet. This appears locked down for now; my office is monitoring it.\n\nADVISOR\nThis gets out, it's game over.\n\nMIKE\nThis conversation gets out...\n\nC.J.\nAnd we're comfortable with that?\n\nBARROW\nWhat's your point?\nADVISOR\nUnderstand, he doesn't wanna go; he has a legal right to apply for asylum.\n\nBARROW\nCan we get back to the real world? The North Koreans are peddling their\nmissile technology all over the Middle East, and sensors on the boarder\nhave picked up elevated levels of Krypton 85. They are making plutonium,\nthey can get it onto warheads, and their best customers are the people who\nhate us. Why are we still talking about this?\n\nMIKE\nI don't see how we can get past the legal issues.\n\nC.J.\nI don't see how you can send someone back to the bleakest place left on the\nplanet after he tells you he doesn't wanna go.\n\nLEO\nC.J....\n\nBARROW\nIt's not that bleak; the DMZ is beautiful; it's like a nature\npreserve.

What's a big problem\nis if he tells anyone else. Where is he now?\n\nC.J.\nSightseeing, he'll be back for rehearsal at 2.30.\n\nBARROW\nDon't let him back in the building. Well, the good news is his handlers\ndon't let him out of their sight. Today it's like they're working for us.\n\nC.J.\nOur very own totalitarian helpmates.\n\nLEO\nExcuse me a minute. C.J....\n\nLeo leaves the room and takes C.J. with him.\n\nLEO\nWhat are you doing?\n\nC.J.\nDon't let him back in the building?\n\nLEO\nWe look at this from every angle.\n\nC.J.\nThe President said he's not sending him back.\n\nLEO\nMy job is to present him with options; your job at the moment is to butt out.\n\nC.J.\nWe've certainly come a long way from give me your tired, your poor.

You've read\nfriends' poetry, had girlfriends.\n\nWILL\nI could use help.\n\nTOBY\nJust hold your nose and hype him.\n\nWILL\nThe President hated this.

He's asked the President of the United States for asylum. Are\nwe saying he'd have been better off asking some cab driver?\n\nBARTLET\nYou know the rationale for sending him back.\n\nLEO\nSo the Iranians don't wake up one morning and decide, hey, it's a good day\nto nuke Israel.\n\nC.J.\nSir, seven North Korean nuclear scientists defected through China last year,\nwe helped pay for it. Are we saying, if this kid were more valuable to us\nwe'd accept him?\n\nBARTLET\nIs that such an unreasonable distinction? But this isn't your real argument.\n\nC.J.\nSending him back will play as a disaster in the press if it ever gets out.\n\nBARTLET\n[shakes head] That's not your real argument either.\n\nC.J.\nNo sir, it's not. This young man's asking for freedom. It's what this country\nwas built on; everyone's from somewhere else, some place less free.

It's a cheap and easy way to get your name\nin the paper, only it's... gonna make you look eccentric, like some kinda\ngoofball crank.\n\nTHEO\nI beg your pardon.\n\nJOSH\nYou're not embarrassing the President, you're embarrassing yourself.\n\nTHEO\nLook...\n\nJOSH\nDo you want the President's backing for anything you might actually want to\naccomplish this term? As opposed to pulling pointless little publicity stunts,\nyou'll swallow hard whatever petty animus you bear toward the guy about to\nbe the number two man in your party, and you will give your President what\nhe wants. A unanimous confirmation.\n\nTHEO\nMy petty animus is that Russell's not good enough. Which is exactly\nwhat you've been saying to each other round here ever since his name was\nannounced. [laughs] You think I don't know how you got rolled on Berryhill,\nor forced to settle for this party hack? You've put someone second-rate next\nin line to a President with a serious health problem.

I got questions about the\neconomy and I felt like I was tap dancing.\n\nLEO\nSaw it, I thought you were fine.\n\nJOSH\nDeft. Extremely deft.\n\nC.J.\nAs much as I appreciate your attempt to complement me out of my point,\nI'm starting to feel a little self-conscious about our lack of vocabulary\nto describe the economy.\n\nBARTLET\nDidn't she get the bagel memo?\n\nJOSH\nYou could argue the President's got a responsibility to do it. Setting a\npositive tone conceivably helps bring about positive results.\n\nC.J.\nIt's not that I wanna don a shroud, I just think the Polly-Anna act's not\nwearing well. Sir, I'm worried that at some point avoidance starts to look\nlike maybe we just haven't noticed. We run the risk of appearing out of\ntouch, like one of those President's who doesn't know the price of milk.

[question is greeted with silence]\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, let's get on coming up with a language plan for talking more\nrealistically about the economy. That session this morning with the advisors;\neverybody's got a magic lever they want you to push. I studied economics all\nmy life but in this job only a fool is ever certain.

Thank you, everyone.\n\nThanks are exchanged and everyone stands up.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J., these negotiations are the real thing. I can't allow this defection.

[Toby stands up] Distinguished is as\nhigh as we go; you have to be high to go loftier. Here's what it should\nbe.

You're\na persuasive man Mr. President, but it helps if you're talking to someone\nwho speaks the language.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're not cancelling the concert.\n\nBARROW\nSir, you're not positive if he got it or not?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nLEO\nThen you need to come down with some flu.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo...\n\nLEO\nOtherwise, we're putting the fate of what is potentially the most significant\ninternational agreement of this Presidency in the hands of a 23-year-old\nwho may have only understood every fifth word of what you were saying.\n\nBARTLET\nWe cancel the concert it's a red flag.

Donna comes to the door.\n\nDONNA\nThank you for earlier.\n\nJOSH\nYou were absolutely right, they were perfectly nice people.\n\nDONNA\nI meant when I went into that whole diet economics harangue.\n\nJOSH\nThat was quite an oratorio.\n\nDonna starts tying Josh's bow tie for him.\n\nDONNA\nI was showing off and it was ridiculous, and you didn't make fun of me and\nI appreciate it.\n\nJOSH\nYou know, the President made almost the exact same basic point this afternoon.\n\nDONNA\nVery funny.\n\nJOSH\nIt's true, actually, it was uncanny.\n\nDONNA\nOh my God.\n\nJOSH\nCourse he left out the whole goofy diet part.\n\nDONNA\nDon't blow it now.\n\nJOSH\nPerfectly nice people... for residents of the only state that consider rind\none of the four major food groups.\n\nJosh puts on his tuxedo jacket and leaves the room, while Donna smiles and\nleaves shortly afterwards.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - EAST ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe concert is in full swing. The room is dimly lit and Jai is playing\nsome Chopin on the piano. We see various White House staffers watching him\nplay. C.J. is standing just outside the room, while Leo and Bartlet are\nshown in the front row. Amy walks down a corridor and comes up behind Josh,\nwho is standing at the entrance to the East Room.\n\nAMY\nGood, I didn't miss it.\n\nJOSH\nNah, there might be 30 or 40 seconds left. [laughs] You look great.\n\nAMY\nThanks, so do you.\n\nJOSH\nEveryone looks great in a tux; chimps look great.\n\nAMY\nWith none actually present I'll have to settle for you.\n\nJOSH\nSo listen, umm, Ryan of all people asked me straight out about our\nrelationship, and I couldn't have avoided the subject more if I had faked\na stroke.\n\nAMY\nCheeky little brat.\n\nJOSH\nThat's not the point, even if I'd wanted to answer him I wouldn't have known\nwhat to say. It's like what C.J. said today about the economy; by refusing\nto put language to it we're trying to pretend it doesn't exist, but it's\nsomething... even if we don't know what to call it. I just think it's time\nto start thinking about a language plan for whatever it is we're doing too.\n\nBack inside the room, Jai reaches the finale of the piece. The White House\nstaffers look on, and when he finishes there is enthusiastic applause. Everyone\nin the room begins to stand up while applauding.\n\nBARTLET\nBravo!\n\nLEO\nBravo!\n\nAfter the applause has stopped, everyone sits down again.\n\nJAI\nLadies, gentlemen, I wish to... [Jai exchanges a longing glance with Bartlet]\nI wish to... thank the President, the American people for this opportunity. I\nwish it be start many exchanges and improve relations between our countries.\n\nJai says something in Korean, in obvious emotional distress, and then bows\nto the audience who applaud him rapturously. He then leaves the stage with\nhis handlers while the applause continues.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nBartlet is alone in the Oval Office. He is lying on the sofa looking\ndismayed. C.J. comes to the door, knocks and enters.\n\nBARTLET\nHe didn't realise what it was.\n\nC.J.\nWhat what was, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nFreedom.\n\nC.J. takes a seat.\n\nC.J.\nYou could have cancelled the concert.\n\nBARTLET\nThere's a Korean word, Han, I looked it up. There is no literal English\ntranslation; it's a state of mind; of soul, really. A sadness; a sadness so\ndeep no tears will come. And yet still, there's hope.\n\nC.J.\nGoodnight, Mr. President. [stands up]\n\nBARTLET\nI got a call from Geneva 15 minutes ago. The negotiations are on hold. The\nNorth Koreans didn't like the size of everyone's flags at the table.\n\nC.J.\n[sighs] Goodnight, sir.\n\nBartlet continues to lie on the sofa looking unhappy, and this time Jai's\nChopin rendition is heard playing.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: MAIN TITLES\nFADE TO BLACK\nTHE END\n\n\nThe West Wing episode 5.04 \"HAN\", original air date 22 October, 2003.\n\n\nTranscribed by David Mercier of www.filmjudge.co.uk\n</pre>"},

We don't have any events on Fridays.\n\nTOBY\nFridays don't count.\n\nWILL\nWhy not?\n\nTOBY\nNo one watches the Friday evening news. No one reads the Saturday\npapers.

But you can run out the clock\non a Bartlet presidency that, politically speaking, is over. You can\nfinish something that you never started in the first place.

Just last week he switched his vote and\njammed us on the stimulus package. That's why we're in this mess. We\nwant to keep rolling over for him?\n\nLEO\nHe's a Democrat from Idaho. They use Democrats for target practice up\nthere. Sometimes, he's got to lean to the right.\n\nJOSH\nSometimes. We give him everything, he screws us everytime. this guy\nmakes Machiavelli look like a social worker.\n\nLEO\nWe need his vote when we bring stimulus up again. We need it on our\nwhole agenda.\n\nJOSH\nSo we award him for rolling us? That'll keep him in line.\n\nLEO\nWe can't afford an ugly fight right now.\n\nJOSH\nUnless we want more and more of them.

If you can't back it up, don't go in the Briefing Room.\n\nC.J.\nWe're here to serve the country.\n\nLEO\nWe are the country.\n\nC.J. turns and walks out.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nBartlet is sitting on the couch reading papers. Charlie enters.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President, Amy Gardner's here.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks, Charlie.\n\nCharlie leaves and Amy enters.\n\nBARTLET\nThe Flemish Bloc is gaining in the north.\n\nAMY\nExcuse me, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nThe Flemish Bloc. The Flemish Bloc, ultra-nationalist in Belgium.\nSkinheads, really, neo-nazis. They're wearing three-piece suits,\nspeaking in coded discourse now instead of angry chants, and they're\ngaining in the north. When everyone wears the same suit, how does anyone\nknow which side they're on anymore?\n\nAMY\nYou asked to see me, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're not fired. Abbey would choose you over me anyway.\n\nAMY\n[sits] I think it's best for me to leave, sir. What I did today,\nlobbying, prodding, prying money out of that HHS SubCommittee, that's\nwhat I'm good at. I wasn't made to serve at someone else's pleasure. I\ndon't think my staying would please anyone anyway.\n\nBARTLET\nShe didn't... I didn't talk to Abbey about this. Zoey told me she was\nhiking.\n\nAMY\nThis building's not very conducive to relationships, sir. I'll call back\nthe members of the Subcommittee before I leave.\n\nAmy gets up to walk out.\n\nBARTLET\nTell 'em the First Lady wants violence prevention fully funded.\n\nAMY\n$100 million?\n\nBARTLET\nMake it a 110.\n\nAmy exits the office and closes the door.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. PORTICO - NIGHT\nLeo's sitting on a bench smoking a cigarette. Toby comes outside.\n\nTOBY\nYou were looking for me?\n\nLEO\nWhat did you want to talk about with the President?\n\nTOBY\nDid I forget the secret password? [sits next to Leo] We talked about my\ngiving up communications, leaving it to Will and focusing on big-picture.\n\nLEO\nThis is not the time?\n\nTOBY\nWhen will it be the time? [stands] Message of the day, top of the news\nhour, our second term and we're acting like a losing campaign.\n\nLEO\nYou're not going in there to lecture him.\n\nTOBY\nStop protecting him.\n\nLEO\nIt's my job to protect him. It's your job to get us back on message.\n\nTOBY\nWill can do it. I'll supervise him.\n\nLEO\nYou supervise him now.\n\nTOBY\nWhat does that matter?\n\nLEO\nIt matters 'cause I need you doing what you're doing now. [stands] I'm\nholding this together with scotch tape and baling wire.\n\nTOBY\nWe have an economic policy held together with scotch tape and baling\nwire. FDR built the middle class in a hundred days. How many days do\nwe even have left?\n\nLEO\n49%. We can't start another New Deal.\n\nTOBY\nHow about fighting for the old one, instead of haggling with Republicans\nover how much to cut? We created nine million jobs. Now they're\ndisappearing. Outsourcing, downsizing, buyouts. They build T.V.'s in\nMexico for a dollar a day, on dirt floors with cardbaord\nwalls...\n\nLEO\nAnd that's our fault?\n\nTOBY\nIt's on our watch, Leo. Where's our hundred days? Where's our Great\nSociety? Where's our New Frontier? Somebody's got to do what we came\nhere to do. Those jobs aren't coming back. We lose our cave every battle\nwe have with Congress, and we have a calendar, not a plan.\n\nLEO\nWill's going to work for the Vice President.\n\nToby walks away and then turns around.\n\nTOBY\nI'm asking the President not to let him.\n\nLEO\nHe told Russell he could have him. It's done.\n\nToby enters the West Wing. Magaret exits into the portico.\n\nLEO\nYou got a problem with your job?\n\nShe hands Leo a piece paper.\n\nMARGARET\nI could use one of those ergonomic chairs.\n\nLEO\nNever mind.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\nJosh is coming up from the basement and runs into Donna.\n\nJOSH\nHey, anything from Amy?\n\nDONNA\nI left messages for her everywhere to come see you.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nDONNA\nThis isn't about the dead fish?\n\nJOSH\nNot exactly, no.\n\nDONNA\nWhat happened?\n\nJOSH\nI think she's been fired--she thinks so. I-I kind of unloaded on her.\n\nDONNA\nJosh...\n\nJOSH\nShe'll be... ah, I don't know what she'll be.\n\nDONNA\nFind her. Forget about budget bills and poll samples and missile\nlaunchers--go find her.\n\nJOSH\nWhat else have I got?\n\nDONNA\nSenator Carrick's in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nJOSH\nChris Carrick's here? Now?\n\nDonna shakes her head in confirmation. Josh leaves Donna and walks to\nthe Roosevelt Room. Before he enters, he sees Amy walking by with her\nthings. But he can call out to her--\n\nCARRICK [OS]\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nSenator.\n\nIn THE ROOSEVELT ROOM, as the senator speaks, Josh and Amy stare at each\nother through the door, then she walks away.\n\nCARRICK\nWell, that was quite a press coup, telling the Idaho papers about my\nanonymous hold.\n\nJOSH\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nCARRICK\nYou know what? Absolutely nothing. I've released the military promotions.\nI can't defend that to the people of Idaho.\n\nJOSH\nI hope that lesson won't be lost when our new stimulus package hits the\nfloor.\n\nCARRICK\nOh, I won't be.\n\nJOSH\nGood.\n\nCARRICK\nJosh, I need one last favor from you.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's that?\n\nThe Senator turns around and takes an envelope from his staffer also\nstanding in the room.\n\nCARRICK\nI've got my own letter here. I'd like you to personally deliver that to\nthe President.\n\nHe slides the envelope across the table to Josh.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's this?\n\nCARRICK\nIt's my letter of resignation from the Democratic Party.\n\nJOSH\nCome again?\n\nCARRICK\nI'm running as a Republican in my next election.\n\nJOSH\nYou're switching parties 'cause we won't give you a launcher that\ndoesn't even...\n\nCARRICK\nThe launcher is a detterant. The launcher says we're serious about\nperfecting missile defense, so rogue governments don't build missile\nprograms.\n\nJOSH\nYou can't be serious...\n\nCARRICK\nBuilding it is more important than whether it works. We don't want it to\never have to work.\n\nJOSH\nWe can't win back the Senate without Idaho. We can't pass the tax bill,\nthe new stimulus package. I'll get you a meeting with Fitzwallace.\nA meeting with the President.\n\nCARRICK\nI don't work for the President. I don't work for you. I work for the\npeople of Idaho.\n\nJOSH\nYou're leaving the party be... this is 'cause of me?!\n\nCARRICK\nI'm not leaving 'cause of you. But you made it a whole lot easier.\n\nThe senator leaves Josh standing absorbing what he's just heard. Josh\nwalks out into the HALLWAY.\n\nMARGARET\nJosh. Leo wants you in the Mural Room.\n\nJosh walks to THE MURAL ROOM. The door is closed. When he opens the\ndoor, the senior staffers all yell--\n\nALL\nSurprise! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!\n\nThe room is decorated and they are wearing party hats and throwing\nconfetti.\n\nALL\n[singing]\nHappy birthday to you\nHappy birthday to you\nHappy birthday, dear Josh...\n\nJosh, still registering a reaction from the news from Chris Carrick,\nenters the room.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin,\nJohn Wells Production, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

And photo ops.\n\nTOBY\nPhoto ops are hope.\n\nC.J. pinches Toby's arm.\n\nBARTLET\nClaudia Jean, did you just pinch Toby?\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir. It was a...

So, are we okay?\n\nTOBY\nSure.\n\nBLAKE\nI thought you might still be mad about last year at the Kennedy School\nForum. Those kids'll laugh at anything.

Maybe he\nmeant \"propagate\", or \"promulgate\".\n\nWILL\nYou put the Vice President into a room with a guy who was winding up to\ntake a swing at the President. He stepped in and took the shot, but he's\nnot happy about it. You need to talk to him.\n\nMargaret walks up to them.\n\nMARGARET\nLeo. There's a... situation.\n\nLEO\nYou're gonna be good at this job.\n\nWill walks off. Leo and Margaret head toward his office.\n\nMARGARET\nThe Secretary of State called twice.

Thank him, for me, would you? I'd almost forgotten the 200 calls I\nhad to make to Berlin.\n\nLeo opens his door and walks into his office. He sees General Alexander\nwaiting on him.\n\nLEO\nOh, dear God, not the goats again. Margaret!\n\nALEXANDER\nIsmaili refuses to discuss a peaceful resolution to the Croxys dispute.\n\nMargaret has come in to Leo's office through her office.\n\nLEO\nLet Josh know I need to see him before Senior Staff.\n\nALEXANDER\nIsmaili wants President Bartlet to broker a deal.\n\nLEO\nWhat do they want; shared custody of the goats? President Bartlet isn't a\nmarriage counselor, or a shepherd, for that matter.\n\nALEXANDER\nYeah, but we're trying to avoid a missile launch from one of the nine warships\nfloating around in the Ionian Sea.\n\nLEO\nMargaret!\n\nMargaret comes in.\n\nLEO\nFind C.J.\n\nMARGARET\nAgain?\n\nShe walks out back into her office.

Governor Wade will arrive and be escorted to her row, and then the\nPresident will enter...\n\nC.J.\nThe President has to enter first.\n\nWOMAN\nPeople want to see the Governor first. She's a familiar, comforting face\nto Oklahomans.\n\nC.J.\nI'm gonna go out on a limb here...\n\nHer phone begins to ring.

Come on in.\n\nJOSH\nI don't know where we're at on capital gains, but I was thinking about this\nBoeing stuff.

She doesn't know the Hill.\n\nLEO\nDamn it, Josh! You tried to humiliate Carrick in his own state, which is\nbad enough, but you failed to the tune of a party switch. You think it ends\nwith the Leadership? You can't believe the calls I'm getting from the DNC\nmembership. State party chairs. No one wants you here. [pause] We're going\nto be late for Senior Staff.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. - OKLAHOMA - DAY\n\nC.J. is walking along.

We need to go back to Washington.\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll leave after the service.\n\nC.J.\nNo, sir. We need to go back now. I told Leo we'd only be here a few hours. He\nneeds you to meet with Singer and the Blue Dogs. The Chancellor is waiting,\nand there's something about a war between ancient civilizations.\n\nBARTLET\nThese people need me.\n\nC.J.\nNo, sir, they don't. Maybe they did yesterday, but now they need their town\nback. They need their police officers working, not clearing intersections\nfor your motorcade. They need the 50 motel rooms we took last night for\npeople who lost their homes. And they need you back in Washington running\nthe country, and creating the jobs that are going to help to pay the taxes\nto help support disaster relief and rebuilding. What are we doing here, sir?\n\nShe turns and walks out of the building.\n\nCUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nLeo is seated at his desk.

We have procedures.\n\nHUTCHINSON\nI am trying to transform a military establishment that hates change. It's a\nnew world. We're facing a new enemy. We need new thinking. Speed, flexibility,\nrapid deployment...\n\nMargaret comes in from her office.\n\nMARGARET\nAir Force One; wheels-up ten minutes ago.\n\nLEO\nThank God.\n\nMargaret leaves.\n\nLEO\nWe agree we need to modernize. But we also have to have unbiased military\nadvise, so I'm gonna need you to stop undermining Alexander and cancel these\ninterviews.

I resent you ignoring the responsibilities of your office. If\nyou want to reach out and touch people, teach math at East Saint Louis after\nyour term expires.\n\nBARTLET\nSo you think my staying longer was some sort of personal indulgence?\n\nC.J.\nI think it's been a difficult time for you sir. For all of us.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's this really about, C.J.?\n\nC.J.\nI understand there was no time, sir. I can't imagine what it was like. I\ndon't have children.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's like I knew who I was, then woke up one morning and didn't have a clue.\n\nC.J.\nI understand, sir. But I need more. You're the President of the United\nStates. My President. I'm frightened. We're all frightened. This is... the\nworld is too dangerous now. Unpredictable. I need you back. I need you to\nlead.

All the stuff we never have time for. The stuff\nwe thought we'd fix when we got here, but we never did. Foreign adoption\npolicy. Hybrid energy partnerships. Extending the roadless conservation\nplan. Okay this one's not a shame, I just didn't want to deal with it. Funding\nspecial education for kids with disabilities. Ammunition control.

Take away a few zeroes\nand he'd\npass for a mob accountant.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry, Mister President, but I don't think Zoey should do this interview.\n\nBARTLET\nThe Diane Mathers thing again?\n\nC.J.\nCharlie got a phone call from one of Mathers' producers. They got his\nstatement to the\nSecret Service about Zoey considering taking the ecstasy and I think they\nmight have\nJean-Paul telling his side of the story.\n\nBARTLET\nAbbey thinks Zoey can handle it.\n\nC.J.\nDiane Mathers is very good at her job. Sir, if you won't let me cancel it,\nat least\nlet me go up there, make sure she's prepared, run some interference.\n\nBartlet nods.\n\nLEO\nTake the earliest flight up tomorrow.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mister President. [leaves]\n\nLEO\nIf you'd like sir, you could travel up with C.J., we could check with advance.\n\nBARTLET\n[looking up from some papers] And Abbey? Who's going to check with her?\n\nLeo looks down, nods.\n\nLEO\nOn the Chief Justice?\n\nBARTLET\nHmm?\n\nLEO\nThe Chief? Do you think we should try to...?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. It's time.\n\nLEO\nThank you, sir.\n\nLeo heads towards his office.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo. Do it delicately.\n\nBartlet takes off his glasses and sighs.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nANGELA\nJosh! Do you have a second?\n\nJOSH\n[blowing his nose] Yeah.\n\nANGELA\nI need to get in a counter offer by this afternoon. The guys at OMB said\nyou have all\nthe current budget docs, budget break-downs, treasury forecasts?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, we started a couple of months ago.\n\nANGELA\nI wonder if I could get it, and borrow a body to help me sort through it?\n\nJOSH\nI got the governors coming in on emission standards, the Japan trip...\n\nANGELA\nThe guy at OMB said someone named Donna. Knows the docs inside out.\n\nANGELA\nI know you're a hell of a ??\n\nJOSH\nDonna Moss. Okay. Sure.\n\nANGELA\nYou're a prince.\n\nThey part.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nTOBY\nYou were looking for me?\n\nMARGARET\nThe labor folks are waiting for you in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nTOBY\nDeductible tuition! What's next? We could save a few bucks by shutting the\neast wing,\nturn the south lawn into the mother of all garage sales.\n\nLEO\nWe're facing our third CR.\n\nTOBY\nIt's process, Leo! Two months from now no one will give a damn about\ncontinuing\nresolutions!\n\nLEO\nYou wanted more responsibility?\n\nTOBY\nWhat about it?\n\nLEO\nThe Chief Justice. The president knows it's time.\n\nTOBY\nThat's not so simple.\n\nLEO\nThat's why I'm giving it to you.\n\nTOBY\nWe can't force him to resign.\n\nLEO\nYeah. No, we can't.\n\nLeo leaves the office.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nTOBY\nHey, Joe?\n\nJoe Quincy, White House associate counsel, turns around.\n\nJOE\nHey, Toby, how ya been?\n\nTOBY\nGood. You?\n\nJOE\nFine.\n\nTOBY\nYou used to clerk for the Chief Justice. That's interesting.\n\nJOE\nIs it? I don't know, I mean if you find it interesting...\n\nTOBY\nI've just never heard you mention it. Guys around here with two-bit appellate\ncourtships staple it to their foreheads.\n\nJOE\nI can't do it, Toby, I'm sorry.\n\nJoe turns, and the two of them begin walking down the HALLWAY.\n\nTOBY\nYou haven't even heard what I'm going to say.\n\nJOE\nYou want me to do the approach, about getting him to resign.\n\nTOBY\nI didn't say that.\n\nJOE\nI can do the math. You've got a limited amount of time to pick the next guy\nand get\nhim confirmed before the midterms politicize everything. But I work for\nyou. It's a\nquestion of propriety.\n\nTOBY\nI see.\n\nJOE\nDo you? The White House can't be seen as pressuring a Supreme Court Justice\nto change\nhis breakfast order, let alone resign. Separation of powers.\n\nTOBY\nI see.\n\nJOE\nYou say that, but in a way that makes me wonder if you really do.\n\nTOBY\nThe President sets the direction of the Court. I've read the Constitution too.\n\nJOE\nHe sets it when there's a vacancy.\n\nTOBY\nYou don't have to ask him to resign, only to sit down with the President.\n\nJOE\nYou're talking about a guy who stood up to six Administrations, 22 Congresses,\nand at\none time or another had half the country ready to lynch him. You think a\nformer clerk\ncan pry him lose? I got a meeting at the OEOB.\n\nJoe turns and walks away.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY\nJosh and Donna are walking through the bullpen.\n\nDONNA\nWhat am I, chattel? There's a request for everything we have on the budget\nfrom Angela\nBlake's office.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, I authorized it.\n\nDONNA\n[surprised] You did?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nThey enter JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nDONNA\nYou know they've also asked me to go with the files, a sort of living index\nif you will\nfor Angela Blake.\n\nJOSH\nWe can call her Angela now.\n\nDONNA\nYou authorized that too?\n\nJOSH\nSure. Did we ever get specifics for...?\n\nDONNA\nOn the trade bill? Right here.\n\nShe hands Josh a file from his desk. Josh sits down and begins to read the\nfile.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\nCharlie is walking down the hallway to C.J.'s office.\n\nC.J. [OS]\nThe NEC chair can brief in my place on budget negotiations...\n\nCharlie stands in the doorway. C.J. is moving around her office putting away\nfiles,\nstill talking loudly.\n\nC.J.\n...I need HHS public affairs, DPC, Toby, and Will to walk them through the\ntalking\npoints, any key developments on the Hill. I have to phone AP and the Post...\n[notices Charlie] Hey Charlie. Because I'm still playing catch-up for leaking\nthat\nexclusive on DOD approps to the Times. [walks to the door] Carol?\n\nCHARLIE\nShe's not out here.\n\nC.J.\nI was just talking to her...\n\nC.J. realizes Carol isn't there. She shakes her head, turns to Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nI wasn't sure if I was going to see you again before you left. Can you give\nthis to\nZoey?\n\nCharlie hands a CD to C.J. She looks at the cover.\n\nC.J.\nI love Macy Gray.\n\nCHARLIE\nZoey's been in a solo, whispery, female acoustic kind of rut right now. I'm\ntrying to\nget her to listen to something with drums.\n\nC.J.\nHow about some John Phillips Sousa?\n\nCHARLIE\nDrums, but not so much with the batons. [pause] My mom used to watch Diane\nMathers all\nthe time.\n\nC.J.\nYeah?\n\nCHARLIE\nWhen she had that talkshow? She seemed nice, sympathetic, sincere.\n\nC.J.\nThis is a woman who gets dictators to cry, talk about their love of puppies\nand momma's\ncooking, confess they had the concentration camps built because they couldn't\nget a\ndate for the prom.\n\nCHARLIE\n[smiling] Zoey's gonna be fine, you know.\n\nC.J.\nSo everyone keeps saying. The President hasn't changed his mind about coming?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo.\n\nC.J.\nI thought he would in the end.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\nAngela and Donna are seated, going over some notes.\n\nANGELA\nThey came up with it in a bar?\n\nDONNA\nYeah. It was that or the hops deduction.\n\nThey laugh.\n\nDONNA\nThere was a guy named Matt Kelley and he was making 50,000 a year. His\ndaughter got\ninto Notre Dame.\n\nANGELA\nSo?\n\nDONNA\nSo, the Bermuda Corporation gets a deduction when they buy off their CEO\nfor a hundred\nmillion a year. Why not pass a break for a guy like Matt?\n\nAngela looks skeptical.\n\nDONNA\nYou don't think so?\n\nANGELA\nIf his daughter had needed braces, would Josh and Toby have come up with a\nplan for\nuniversal orthodontia?\n\nDONNA\nNot a chance, huh?\n\nANGELA\nWe can still get tax-deductible tuition. We can get a lot of things. We got\nto get them\nto give it, that's all. How do you think we're doing?\n\nDONNA\n[smiles shyly] Me? I don't...\n\nANGELA\nYou're an American citizen, you pay taxes, consume government services.\n\nDonna considers for a moment, tucking her hair behind her ear.\n\nDONNA\nI think... our side has done a bad job explaining that what we're fighting\nfor is\nimportant. It's not about abstract programs and endless acronyms, but real\nthings that\naffect real people, like affording college.\n\nANGELA\nYou talk to Josh about this?\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nToby falls into step beside Joe.\n\nJOE\nWe both going to the ONDCP briefing?\n\nTOBY\nNo. We're going in here.\n\nHe holds open a door to a ROOM. Joe enters, and Toby closes the door.\n\nJOE\nGee Toby, people are going to talk.\n\nToby sighs.\n\nTOBY\nI'm curious. It wouldn't be for the obvious reason, would it?\n\nJOE\nWhat's the obvious reason?\n\nTOBY\nYou're a conservative. Maybe you'd love to see him stay on the bench. A\nliberal icon\nreduced to a quivering mass of octogenarian confusion!\n\nJOE\nHold on...\n\nTOBY\nHanging on until he can be replaced by a paleo Republican! The Constitution's\na living\ndocument. You stick to it like it's a boiler plate lease!\n\nJOE\nYou don't know what the hell you're talking about!\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nJOE\nEvery year, he likes to hire a conservative clerk to argue with, and arguing\nwith him\nhelped me to clarify the things I believe in. And one of those things is an\nindependent\ncourt, above party or interests.\n\nTOBY\nHe has memory lapses. He drifts during oral arguments.\n\nJOE\nHe has his good and bad days.\n\nTOBY\nThe associate Justices are already postponing decisions, holding over\nimportant cases,\ngoing behind his back to assign opinions!\n\nJOE\nYou don't know that.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, I do. There's no one else left, Joe. He's outlived his wife, his son\nwas shot\ndown over Hanoi. There's just his clerks, clerks like you.\n\nJOE\nYou can't do anything!\n\nTOBY\nLet's go over there together right now, you and me.\n\nJOE\nTo the hospital?\n\nTOBY\nHe'll see you. You tell me he's okay, and I'll call off the vultures.\n\nCUT TO: INT. A HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - DAY\nToby and Joe stand, not talking. The doors open, and they exit, approaching\na young\nwoman, who works in the Chief Justice's office.\n\nJOE\nHey Lisa, you catch the night shift?\n\nLISA ZIMMER\n[standing] Six to midnight. Steve's coming in to handle the overnights.\n\nThey hug.\n\nJOE\nThis is Toby Ziegler.\n\nToby, this is Lisa Zimmer, one of the Justice's clerks.\n\nLISA\nSure, I've seen you on Crossfire. I hope you won't be offended, Mr. Ziegler,\nbut we're\nkeeping it to family only. You know, friends, colleagues.\n\nTOBY\nI just came along to keep Joe company. I saw a coffee cart in the lobby. You\nwant\nanything?\n\nJOE\nI'm good.\n\nTOBY\nLisa?\n\nLisa shakes her head.\n\nTOBY\nI'll be downstairs when you're done.\n\nToby turns and walks back towards the elevator.\n\nJOE\nSo?\n\nLISA\nI don't know what they've told you, but he always bounces back.\n\nJoe looks concerned. He starts to go down the HALLWAY.\n\nLISA\nJoe.\n\nJoe turns around.\n\nLISA\nHe always does.\n\nJoe enters the CHIEF JUSTICE'S ROOM.\n\nJOE\nSir? Mr. Chief Justice?\n\nJoe approaches the Justice's bed. We hear beeping in the background. The\nChief Justice\nis unconscious. We see that he is attached to a number of medical monitors,\nincluding\nan oxygen mask. Joe looks concerned and alarmed. Clearly, he did not expect\nthe Justice\nto be this badly off. Joe pulls the blanket up.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nTOBY\nJoe?\n\nJOE\nI gave him the President's regards.\n\nTOBY\nWhat'd he say? How is he? Was he coherent?\n\nJOE\nYou know why I didn't want it to spread that I clerked for him? Because I\nknew someday\nsomebody like you would come up to me and ask me to do something like this.\n\nTOBY\nSo he's alright?\n\nJOE\n[disgusted and angry] You guys. You think it's all a game. You're treating\nthe Court\nlike it's Tamany Hall gone national.\n\nTOBY\nYour side does it better, pushing neo-conservatives in swaddling clothes,\nhoping they\ndon't grow a conscience, let alone a meager understanding of jurisprudence.\n\nJOE\nMaybe we could all do it better. But there is such a thing called judicial\nindependence.\nA lifetime appointment! He's still alive so he gets to decide when it's time!\n\nTOBY\n[softly] What did he'd say? Or can he even speak?\n\nJOE\nHe's fine, Toby. He was up, joking. He'll be back in chambers in a couple\nof days.\n\nJoe walks away. Toby watches him go.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: EXT. A DIRT ROAD - DAY\nA car drives down a dirt road. We see Abbey and Zoey on the porch of the\nMANCHESTER\nHOUSE as the car pulls up. In the background, a T.V. crew sets up equipment.\n\nAbbey touches Zoey's shoulder as she goes inside the house. C.J. gets out\nof the car\nand smiles at Zoey.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\nJosh sneezes and blows his nose. Margaret walks up.\n\nMARGARET\nHey, how are you feeling?\n\nJOSH\nGood!\n\nMARGARET\n[hands him some papers] The President's remarks on opening Japan's microchip\nmarket,\nand complaining about autos and flat glass.\n\nJOSH\nFlat glass, excellent!\n\nMargaret just looks at him.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a new thing I'm doing, sort of a positive attitude thing.\n\nMARGARET\nJust thought I'd check to see if you needed anything. Donna's still helping\nAngela.\n\nJOSH\nStill?\n\nMARGARET\nYeah, I guess the negotiations went pretty late after 2:00. They're due to\nresume in\nabout 20 minutes.\n\nJOSH\n[disbelieving] Donna's in the budget negotiations?\n\nMARGARET\n[nods] I guess.\n\nJOSH\n[not looking particularly happy] Outstanding!\n\nMargaret turns and leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY\nToby is at his desk. Joe walks in and shuts the door.\n\nJOE\nHow's it going?\n\nTOBY\n[clears his throat] I think I'm coming down with something.\n\nJOE\nI'm sorry.\n\nTOBY\nYou say that, but in a way that makes me wonder if you really are.\n\nJoe sits down across from Toby.\n\nJOE\nI can still feel it, you know. The first time I ever got called in to his\noffice and\nyelled at about something he'd read in my law review note. He'd read my law\nreview\nnote! And all I could think was, this is the guy. He's why a cop has to read\na criminal\nhis rights. He's why a couple of mixed race can get married in the state of\nTexas.\nI spent three nights as a one-L trying to pick apart his Baines versus\nU.S. Steel.\nI couldn't do it.\n\nToby smiles briefly, sits back in his chair.\n\nTOBY\nI was in a room with Ashland once.\n\nToby gets up, walks around his desk, and perches on the side.\n\nTOBY\nI was a student at City College. Student organizing committee got him to\ngive a speech\nabout the history of voting rights. We were hanging from the rafters.\n\nJoe smiles.\n\nTOBY\nI talked to him afterwards. I mean, he wouldn't remember me. But I spent\nthe next six\nweeks organizing a voter registration drive. You know when you go out West\nhow they\nsay, don't miss the Grand Canyon, it's one of the few things in life that\nwhen you see\nit, it doesn't disappoint? That's Roy Ashland.\n\nJOE\n[beat] He was unconscious last night. Never came out of it, never said a word.\n\nTOBY\n[sighs] I don't want to see him gone, Joe. I want nine Ashlands on the\ncourt. I just-I\njust wish he was 40 years younger.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MANCHESTER HOUSE - DAY\nC.J. is giving advice to Zoey and Abbey. We see Secret Service agents outside.\n\nC.J.\nDiane likes to keep things warm, casual, but she'll try to zing you with\nsome indirect\nattribution like \"People say,\" or \"There's a rumor that.\"\n\nABBEY\nFor example?\n\nC.J.\nThere's a rumor that you're seeing a therapist.\n\nABBEY\n[immediately and a little defensively] You don't have to answer that.\n\nC.J.\n[calmly] If you don't answer, she'll just wait, like an infinitely forgiving,\ninfinitely patient cross between the Virgin Mary and a schnouzer.\n\nABBEY\nIt's nobody's business.\n\nZOEY\nMom, I want to answer. Yes, I'm seeing a therapist.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nZOEY\nI couldn't have dealt with this completely on my own, and I've had lots of\nsupport\nfrom friends and family, but I also needed help. I've gotten some, and it's,\nyou know,\nbeen good.\n\nC.J.\nThe help's helped.\n\nZOEY\n[laughs] Great, I'll use that, thanks.\n\nC.J.\nZoey, we need to take a moment and talk about that night at the club with\nJean-Paul.\nHad you agreed to take drugs?\n\nAbbey looks down.\n\nCUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY\nMen and women in dark suits are leaving the building. Josh watches them go\nby, then\nwalks in to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM, where Donna, Angela, Leo, and some staffers\nare.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEO\nWe're having a bit of a breakdown. If \"breakdown\" is the word.\n\nANGELA\nWorks for me.\n\nJOSH\nWhat happened?\n\nSTAFFER\nThey don't want to deal is what happened. The capital gains cut...\n\nANGELA\n[breaks in] They came back and said it's not negotiable. They want to make\nit bigger.\n\nJOSH\nSo, what now?\n\nANGELA\nAnother continuing resolution, till Christmas this time.\n\nJOSH\nYou've got to be kidding. You let it drag on that long, they'll try to\nde-fund the\nYule log.\n\nANGELA\nIt gets better. They're not willing to continue funding at the current\nlevel. They\nwant a one percent cut on everything except defense and homeland security.\n\nJOSH\nHow could this happen?\n\nLEO\n[a note of warning in his voice] Josh.\n\nJOSH\nNo, Leo. How is this acceptable? Haffley's not the Prime Minister. You take\nthis to\nthe President, you know what he'll say?\n\nLEO\nHe'll say yes.\n\nJOSH\nHow can you say that?\n\nLEO\nTo keep the lights on. To make sure a couple million federal employees keep\non getting\npaid. It's two more months.\n\nJOSH\nThis isn't governing, it's duck and cover.\n\nLEO\nHe'll say that, too.\n\nLeo leaves. Angela and Donna get up and start gathering their things.\n\nJOSH\nAt least be...\n\nANGELA\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nI don't know. Embarrassed.\n\nDONNA\nIt wasn't her.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nDONNA\nYou know the hand she was dealt.\n\nJOSH\nYou're saying it was me.\n\nDONNA\nNo. I'm saying we may have won in a landslide, but we didn't take Congress\nwith us, and\nnow it looks like we're not taking the country with us, and the other guys\nknow it.\n\nThey look at each other for a moment.\n\nDONNA\nGotta get back to work.\n\nDonna leaves. Josh stares off into space for a moment.\n\nJOSH\nIt's nice when you make new friends.\n\nANGELA\nYou know, all this time she's been fighting for you, for your plan to send\neveryone to\ncollege.\n\nJOSH\nIt's not a bad plan.\n\nANGELA\nNo, and they didn't think so either. I even think they wanted to go along\nwith it, run\nads they voted for it. But we'd have had to squeeze Medicaid, the EITC,\npoor people\npaying for college kids and Wall Street. I don't think that Jed Bartlet\nwould have\nsigned off on that!\n\nJosh leaves the room before she finishes. Angela sighs.\n\nANGELA\n[to an empty room] I got you till Christmas.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

MANCHESTER HOUSE - DAY\nZoey is seated on a sofa, dressed nicely in a shirt and skirt, talking to\nDiane\nMathers. Video equipment fills one half of the room.\n\nZOEY\nI don't think anyone should try to go through something like this alone.\n\nDIANE MATHERS\nAnd has it helped?\n\nZOEY\nYes. The help's helped.\n\nShe pauses. Diane doesn't react, so Zoey continues.\n\nZOEY\nA lot.\n\nDIANE\nI think we can all see that.\n\nZOEY\nGood, I'm glad.\n\nDIANE\nZoey, I know this will be difficult. But what happened that night at the\nclub with\nJean-Paul and the ecstasy?\n\nWe see Abbey and C.J. standing off to one side, watching the interview.\n\nDIANE\nYou know he says that you...\n\nZOEY\nI know what he says.\n\nDIANE\nYou sound angry.\n\nZOEY\nI am angry. But the only thing I can do, the only thing any of us can do,\nis to tell\nthe truth about what happened to us, and try to find a way to live with the\nshame and\nself-doubt that comes with having trusted someone who then betrayed you.\n\nDIANE\nIs there anything you'd like to say to Jean-Paul?\n\nHer voice fades as the camera follows Abbey, who has left the room, her hand\nover her\nmouth. C.J. follows her.\n\nABBEY\n[distraught] How much longer?\n\nC.J.\nShe'll be wrapping up. That was her big gun.\n\nABBEY\nThank you. She did well. You did an excellent job.\n\nC.J.\nYou, too.\n\nABBEY\nThat's why she needed time up here.\n\nC.J.\nI meant you've raised a remarkable young woman.\n\nABBEY\nOh. She was always Jed's little girl.

Please don't be offended if I say I don't miss you.\n\nThey both laugh, but a bit awkwardly.\n\nC.J.\nIt's been very busy.

[shakes his\nfinger at Bartlet] But they won't confirm them, will they? I have good days,\nand bad.\nBut on my worst day, I am better than the ambulance chasers you can get\nconfirmed by\nthe Senate. You can't do it, Jed. You're not strong enough. The Speaker's\nrunning the\ntable. And I can't take a chance.\n\nOutside, lightning flashes. Bartlet looks pensive.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nDonna sticks her head in.\n\nDONNA\nThey're here.\n\nJosh gets up immediately and follows her out of the office. We see Haffley\nand his\naides get out of cars outside of THE WEST WING, then walk though the\nLOBBY. Josh and\nDonna join Will outside the BULLPEN AREA as the Republicans walk by.\n\nJOSH\nThey all here?\n\nWILL\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\n[to Donna] Go.\n\nDonna looks hesitant.\n\nJOSH\nGo.\n\nDonna nods and walks after the Republicans into THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Inside,\nmany\npeople are milling around and talking. Bob Russell walks up to Haffley.\n\nRUSSELL\nMr. Speaker.\n\nHAFFLEY\nMr. Vice President.\n\nLEO\n[to Haffley] The President is finishing up a meeting. He'll be right in.\n\nSENATOR ROBERT ROYCE [R - PA] approaches Leo.\n\nROBERT ROYCE\nAny word on the Chief Justice?\n\nLEO\nThat's the meeting.\n\nROYCE\nHe's in the White House?\n\nLEO\nCame straight from his adjustable bed. Man's a force of nature.\n\nBartlet enters the room. Everyone takes their places around the table,\nincluding\nBartlet, Russell, Leo, Angela, Donna, Haffley, and Royce.\n\nBARTLET\nMr. Speaker, Senator.\n\nROYCE\nI want to thank you, Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues. None of us\nthinks\nthis is a perfect deal. No one likes to see the sausage made, including the\nguys who\nmake it. But this is an expression of willingness by both sides to keep all\navenues\nopen to an eventual resolution.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, thanks, Robert. And thanks for saying it this time. I think I had to\nmake that\nlittle speech the last time around.\n\nEveryone smiles.\n\nBARTLET\nOr maybe the time before. This is our third CR, our third time coming up\nshort. We\nhave to do better. People aren't paying us to duck the hard choices. You\nwant to run\nthrough the details, Angela?\n\nEveryone sits down.\n\nANGELA\nAn act of Congress. Continuing resolution to extend no later than January\n3rd,\nmidnight, to include a reduction of one percent.\n\nHAFFLEY\nExcuse me, Mr. President, I'm sorry. There's been a change. I know we talked\nabout a\none percent cut. It's going to have to be three.\n\nANGELA\nMr. Speaker, nothing like this was even mentioned, much less disc--\n\nBARTLET\nHold on.\n\nHAFFLEY\nI'm sorry I couldn't give more notice, but I just came from our conference,\nand I had\nsignificant opposition to only one percent.\n\nBARTLET\nOnly one percent.\n\nHAFFLEY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWe had a deal at one percent.\n\nHAFFLEY\nBut now my members have to go back to their districts for the holidays,\nexplain why we\nkept the gravy train running with a rising deficit and an economy crying\nout for tax\nrelief. It's an economic situation that calls for action, not status quo\nspending. Now\nthree percent may sound painful but it's only for two months. It'll show\nwe're serious.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's next?\n\nHAFFLEY\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nIn two months. Five percent? 50? How many rounds do we go, Jeff? I'm just\nasking.\n\nHAFFLEY\nThere is no next, sir. I mean not to get too technical, but this government\nruns out\nof money at midnight. And my guys are going home. This is it.\n\nBartlet considers this for a moment. Then he shakes his head.\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nHAFFLEY\nThere is no altering this offer, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet stands. Everyone else quickly follow.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd I said no.\n\nHAFFLEY\nLet's be clear, sir. We cannot, we will not, vote to keep on footing the\nbill. You\nwill be held responsible for shutting down the federal government.\n\nBARTLET\nThen shut it down.\n\nThe lights shut off.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END CREDITS.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo enters with Angela.\n\nLEO\nSir, you want to talk about what just happened?\n\nBARTLET\n[signing some papers] You were there. Make sure Nancy sees me in the morning\nabout the ?\nin Indonesia. I don't want any training East of Kupan. Anything else?\n\nLEO\nWe need a continuing resolution by midnight of 940,000 federal employees\naren't going to show up in the morning.\n\nBARTLET\nGive them your shirt, they want your built.\n\nANGELA\n[forcefully] We have to get them back in.\n\nBARTLET\nNot tonight. [checks his watch] Damn! I probably missed the first\nhalf. Providence is\ngoing to get a whopping from my fighting Irish.\n\nBartlet exits via the portico. Charlie enters from the outer office.\n\nCHARLIE\n[to Leo] Is he coming back?\n\nLEO\nWhat do you need?\n\nCHARLIE\nToby and Josh are here.\n\nLeo nods, and Charlie allows Josh and Toby to enter the Oval Office.\n\nJOSH\nWhat the hell happened?\n\nANGELA\nHaffley asked for three percent.\n\nTOBY\nNow what?\n\nLEO\nWe shut it down.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nMAN\n[on T.V.] I went to the White House to pass a continuing resolution while\nwe work\nthrough our differences. But this President couldn't find three percent of\na 1.2\ntrillion budget to cut to keep the government open and working.\n\nLeo sees the T.V. but keeps walking. He enters a room where many West Wing\nassistants\nare, including Charlie, Margaret, and Donna.\n\nLEO\nListen up. Hey.\n\nEveryone keeps talking.\n\nCHARLIE\n[yelling] Hey people, shut up!\n\nThe room quiets.\n\nLEO\n[to Charlie] Thank you. [to the room] Effective immediately, the\nU.S. government is shut\ndown. We have no operating budget, so all non-essential personnel, anyone\nbelow special\nassistant, non-national security and public safety, go home until further\nnotice. The\nPresident thanks you for your hard work and service. Questions?\n\nSeveral people raise their hands. Leo nods at Donna.\n\nDONNA\nHow long do you think it will last?\n\nLEO\nHours, probably, maybe a day.\n\nMARGARET\nMaybe a couple days?\n\nLEO\nMaybe.\n\nMARGARET\nMaybe a couple weeks?\n\nLEO\nIt will last as long as it lasts. Listen guys, I'm sorry.\n\nC.J. and Toby pass in back of the group. Leo's talk continues in the background\nas we\nfollow C.J. and Toby. Carol joins them, walking behind them as they walk\ntowards C.J.'s\noffice.\n\nC.J.\nAre they coming back tonight?\n\nTOBY\nI sure as hell hope so.\n\nC.J.\nAmtrak, the courts, federal prisons, border patrol, national weather service,\nall open,\nand meat inspectors will remain on the job.\n\nTOBY\n[sarcastic] Nothing jeopardizes the sanctity of the American hamburger.\n\nThey enter C.J.'S OFFICE.\n\nC.J.\nThe EPA is suspending 60 percent of factory inspections. Good news for\npolluters.\n\nTOBY\nNow tell me.\n\nC.J.\n[putting on her suit jacket] We had agreed to a one percent cut on a 30 day\ncontinuing\nresolution, but the Speaker pulled a bait-and-switch.\n\nTOBY\n[pretending to be a reporter] One percent, two percent, what's so unreasonable\nabout\nthree percent?\n\nC.J.\nThree percent equals X dollars, which is Y flu vaccinations, Z school\nlunches.\n\nToby looks skeptical.\n\nC.J.\nIt's more convincing with numbers. Carol!\n\nCAROL\nIt's going to take me a minute, because we just sent research home. And... you\njust\nsent me home, too.\n\nTOBY\n[sighing] I'll get you the numbers.\n\nC.J. watches the T.V. in her office, where the Speaker is still talking to\nthe press.\n\nC.J.\n[incredulous] He's on the front lawn?!\n\nCAROL\nHe wrangled the reporters from our room.\n\nC.J.\nIs there anyone left?\n\nCAROL\nA couple.\n\nC.J.\nShould I wait for Haffley to finish?\n\nTOBY\nWe gotta start reclaiming some ground.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, but I need some numbers fast, maybe some garlic and a crucifix.\n\nShe leaves her office.\n\nCAROL\n[to Toby] What should I...?\n\nTOBY\n[following C.J.] Go home.\n\nThe camera follows C.J. as she enters the PRESS ROOM and stands at the\npodium. Only a few\nreporters are in the room, and they are gathering their belongings.\n\nC.J.\nGood evening everybody. Katie, get back here. Let's start with the good\nnews. National\nsecurity and public safety will not be affected.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nJosh and Donna are walking.\n\nDONNA\nThis is so unfair. We're already understaffed.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nI cancelled tomorrow's meetings with SBA and the SCC.\n\nJOSH\nYou do realize you're not a special assistant.\n\nDONNA\nThanks for reminding me. How far out do you want me to...?\n\nJOSH\n[interrupting] Donna, listen carefully. You have to go home.\n\nDONNA\n[surprised] Seriously?\n\nJosh nods.\n\nDONNA\nSo, Leo said everyone below special assistant.\n\nJOSH\nHe meant you.\n\nDonna looks disappointed. Josh enters his office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nHaffley is still on the T.V. as Toby walks into LEO'S OFFICE. A phone is\nringing at\nMargaret's desk.\n\nTOBY\nYour phones are ringing.\n\nLEO\nYeah. Margaret went home.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's the President doing?\n\nLEO\nWatching basketball.\n\nTOBY\nDoes he have a plan?\n\nLEO\nI think it was pretty spontaneous.\n\nTOBY\n[sounding frustrated] If it doesn't end now, it'll become a referendum on\nthe Bartlet\nPresidency.\n\nLEO\n[sounding unconcerned] Yup.\n\nTOBY\nDo you want me to talk to him?\n\nLEO\nNo, I've got it.\n\nCUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY\nC.J. is still briefing the press.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nGeorge.\n\nGEORGE\nIsn't this a bluff? I mean, there's going to be a deal reached by midnight\nlike there\nis every year, right?\n\nC.J.\nWell, I can't speak for Congress, but the President will not cut essential\nservices,\nwhich is what their CR does.\n\nC.J. points to Katie.\n\nKATIE\nIsn't it irresponsible of the President to refuse to sign, disrupting people's\nlives and\npaychecks, over three percent...\n\nC.J.\n[checking her notes] Three percent equals more than a billion dollars in\neducation\nfunding, clean energy funding, highway safety, to name a few. I'll get you\nexact\nfigures.\n\nC.J. points to another reporter.\n\nREPORTER\nThe speaker said this continuing resolution was the express will of both\nthe House and\nthe Senate.\n\nC.J.\nIt wasn't the will of the 196 congressmen and 16 senators who voted against\nall 14\nappropriations bills.\n\nREPORTER\nIf these services are so vital, why isn't the President still negotiating?\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\nDonna is putting items in a box. Josh is seated on his desk, watching.\n\nDONNA\nI'm taking stationery, a stapler, three pens of various colors, the budget\nfiles.\n\nJOSH\nWhy don't you just take them on disk?\n\nDONNA\nBecause I don't have a computer. Can I take a computer with me?\n\nJOSH\nNot unless you want three federal agents trailing you home.\n\nDONNA\nDo I get to pick which three?\n\nJOSH\nI can survive for a day.\n\nDONNA\nIs that all it's going to last? A day?\n\nJOSH\nOkay, take my laptop.\n\nHe jumps off his desk and goes to get his laptop.\n\nJOSH\nStart a tally of programs affected by the shutdown, and email it to me as\nyou go.\nDon't read anything in the folder marked \"private.\"\n\nDonna stares at him.\n\nJOSH\nDon't take my laptop. [puts it back down]\n\nWILL\n[sticking his head in the office] You coming? War room. [exits]\n\nDONNA\nWhat's happening?\n\nJOSH\nYou remember when we went to Atlantic City?\n\nDONNA\nWe never went to Atlantic City.\n\nJOSH\nRemember when I went to Atlantic City and I came back complaining that all\nthe pro\npoker players suck all the fun out of the game, no cigars, no pizza, no beer.\n\nDONNA\nYou played one hand.\n\nJOSH\nThose guys, they bet the bank when they have a good hand. And you either fold,\nor you\ngo in all the way with them. I think the President's gonna stay in.\n\nDONNA\nAnd how good is Haffley?\n\nJOSH\nHe's better than anyone we've seen on the other side of the table in a long\ntime.\n\nHe leaves his office to go to the war room. Donna picks up her box of stuff\nand leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. REPUBLICAN WAR ROOM - DAY\nHaffley, other GOP Congressional representatives, and aides are working.\n\nHAFFLEY\nI figured they'd negotiate us down to two, but a shutdown? They're not\nprepared for\nthis.\n\nWOMAN\nAre we?\n\nHAFFLEY\nWe didn't shut down the government, Bartlet did. He's the one who's going\nto have to\nexplain it to the country.\n\nROYCE\n[entering] Sorry. Took me a while to figure out how to un-jam the copier. If\nthey come\nback with two percent, we can pass the CR tonight.\n\nHAFFLEY\nWhy would we? He thinks people want big government. Let's show them how well\nthe\nAmerican people can get by without the deputy director of regulatory\nintrusion.\n\nROYCE\nThey'll call tonight. They won't want it to drag on.\n\nWOMAN\nYou've spoken to Russell?\n\nROYCE\nNot yet, but that's who they'll use.\n\nHAFFLEY\n[rolling up his sleeves] So long as they blink first, it doesn't matter who\ncalls.\n\nMAN\nIn the meantime we have congressmen looking for toner cartridges, and I have\n35,000\nfederal employees in my district out of work.\n\nHAFFLEY\n[leaning on the table] Get on the phone with your local media. Make sure\nthey know who\nthrew us out of the White House. Make sure those 35,000 people know who sent\nthem home.\n\nRoyce looks skeptical as Haffley starts looking through papers.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY\nAngela Blake is walking with a large pile of papers. She enters THE WAR\nROOM. Leo,\nJosh, Will, and Toby are already there.\n\nJOSH\nHey, advisory board still at ten tomorrow?\n\nLEO\nYeah. Treasury is worried about the debt ceiling.\n\nJOSH\nI left word with violence prevention and business roundtable, but what about\nthe\naddress to the NAACP tomorrow? Should we cancel? It's non-governmental,\nwe'll need\nadvance.\n\nLEO\nDon't cancel anything yet. Angela thinks we'll get an agreement tonight.\n\nTOBY\n[rolling up his sleeves] What kind of agreement?\n\nANGELA\nMy guess is he would have settled on two percent had the meeting\ncontinued. It's\nprobably still available.\n\nLEO\nAnd tomorrow?\n\nANGELA\nDepends on how it plays in the morning papers.\n\nJOSH\n[forcefully] We have to call Haffley out for what he's really doing. It's\na coup. He's\ntrying to de-fund every Bartlet initiative we passed in the last two years.\n\nLEO\n[evenly] The President has a full schedule tomorrow, Josh. Go make sure\neveryone knows\nhe intends to keep it.\n\nJosh looks disappointed and a little hurt at the dismissal.\n\nLEO\nCan we downplay this to the press?\n\nTOBY\nThat's what Haffley wants. 940,000 federal employees out of work, but we say,\nno\nworries, doesn't matter.\n\nJosh gathers his papers and leaves the room. Toby looks like he disagrees\nwith Leo's\ntreatment of Josh, but he doesn't say anything. We hear the following\ndiscussion as the\ncamera follows Josh out and down the HALLWAY.\n\nWILL\nI may be having some kind of mental logjam, but why did the President snap?\n\nLEO\nAngela had the thing wired and Haffley tried to roll us. It was a mugging.\n\nWILL\nBut it's also a negotiation. You don't shoot a duck for quacking.\n\nLEO\nAre you speaking for the Vice President?\n\nWILL\nThe quacking thing kind of gives it away, doesn't it?\n\nC.J. enters the room.\n\nC.J.\nHelp.\n\nLEO\nDon't go out there again until morning.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, but the enemy's advancing, and you better give me more than a squirt\ngun before\nthe sun comes up.\n\nWILL\nWe need some coffee. Anyone know where we can get coffee?\n\nTOBY\nThe mess is closed. There's no coffee.\n\nC.J.\nStarbucks closes at 7:00. Try Swaine's at 17th and G.\n\nWill leaves.\n\nLEO\nWhat else?\n\nC.J.\nThe British Prime Minister...\n\nLEO\nIsn't visiting for four days. One day at a time.\n\nC.J.\nIt's a state dinner, 216 guests, formal attire...\n\nLEO\nJosh can handle it. What else?\n\nTOBY\nWe can put together a strategy, but Leo, there isn't anything else until we\nsign a\ndeal.\n\nANGELA\nYou have to talk the President down of the ledge tonight. If I go back and\nhammer out\na deal at two percent, he has to sign it.\n\nCUT TO: INT. ELEVATOR IN THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT\nLeo steps out of elevator and walks down the hall.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS\nWe see the President eating peanuts and watching his basketball game on\ntelevision.\nSomeone knocks on the study door.\n\nBARTLET\nCome in!\n\nLeo enters the room.\n\nLEO\nGood evening, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, grab a seat.\n\nLEO\nWhat's the score?\n\nBARTLET\nDoesn't matter. The game is won or lost in the last five minutes.\n\nLEO\nSo the Irish are down.\n\nBartlet just looks at him. Leo sits. Bartlet continues to watch the game. Leo\nhesitates,\nthen finally begins a bit hesitantly.\n\nLEO\nSir, I've got Angela running the war room, but we don't have a lot of support\ninside or\noutside the building.\n\nThe President continues to watch the game.\n\nLEO\nAngela feels they'll close at 2 percent.\n\nBARTLET\nI took his Vice President, I dropped my stimulus package, my college tuition\ntax credit,\nand now we're haggling not over the budget, but over how much to cut.\n\nLEO\nIt's a bad deal, a bad week, a bad year. But our approval's in the 30s and\nwe're out of\nallies on the hill. Let's get past this budget cycle, make a deal at 2\npercent tonight,\nnot let it become a noose around our necks. Then, we can get back on message,\nbe bold\nat the State of the Union, take back Congress.\n\nBARTLET\nDammit! They've got a seven foot center and best power center in the game. Why\nzone?\n\nLEO\nIt's not always enough to be right sir.\n\nBartlet looks away from the game and stares at Leo for a moment before\nreturning to\nthe game.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. WEST WING OFFICE - DAY\n\n\tDAY TWO\n\nWe see a child with a very whiny voice on television.\n\nCHILD\nIt's not fair! We drove all the way from to see grandma and the\nConstitution. Now we\nonly get to see Grandma!\n\nThe camera pans down and we see Leo and C.J. walking down the HALLWAY.\n\nLEO\nHow'd the press react to your closing down the briefing room?\n\nC.J.\nLet's just say it hasn't won me any new friends in the media.\n\nLEO\nThis thing will be won or lost depending on how it plays on TV.\n\nC.J.\nThey're blaming us.\n\nLEO\nAny change in the overnights?\n\nThey enter LEO'S OFFICE.\n\nC.J.\nThey keep saying they're Scrooge, denying the needy. They say we're addicted\nto\nspending. Both our negatives are up, but ours more.\n\nC.J.\nYou see Newsweek?\n\nLEO\nBeats the cover of Time.\n\nC.J.\nThe Post is reporting 193,000 veterans can't get their home loans processed. We\ncan't\nbe doing this over the holidays.\n\nLEO\nWe won't be.\n\nC.J.\nSo what's the plan?\n\nLEO\nPlan? Who said we had a plan?\n\nLeo throws Time down on his desk. It has a picture of Haffley with the\nheadline, \"The\nNew Boss?\" Leo hangs up his jacket.\n\nRUSSELL [OS]\nGot a minute, Leo?\n\nLEO\nOf course, Mr. Vice President, please. [to C.J.] I'll see you at the thing?\n\nC.J. nods and leaves. Russell enters the office and takes a seat in front\nof Leo's\ndesk. Leo flips over Time.\n\nRUSSELL\nHow's the President doing?\n\nLEO\nHe's fighting a cold.\n\nRUSSELL\nThink it's about time for me to talk to a few of my former colleagues in\nthe House?\n\nLEO\nMmm, not yet sir, no.\n\nRUSSELL\nI served on energy with Haffley.\n\nLEO\nI appreciate that.\n\nRUSSEL\nI sang in the Congressional Quartet with the majority whip. I've gotten\ndrunk on\nfact-finding with most of the guys...\n\nLEO\n[interrupting] With all due respect sir, we can't send mixed signals.\n\nRUSSELL\nYou saw their deal two days ago and turned them down. If you're waiting for\nHaffley to\ncall, you've misjudged your man. You can't treat the Speaker like...\n\nLEO\n[interrupting again] The President will decide the terms.\n\nRUSSELL\nNo, he won't! Like it or not, we have a Republican Congress. They get to\nwrite the\nbudget. The President only gets to edit it a bit. You want to blame someone,\ncall\nJames Madison.\n\nLEO\n[politely sarcastic] Thanks for the history lesson, sir. I'll be sure to\npass it on to\nthe President.\n\nLeo sits and puts on his glasses. Russell sighs and stands. He moves to the\ndoor, then\nturns.\n\nRUSSELL\nYou know what they call a leader with no followers? Just a guy talking a walk.\n\nRussell leaves. Leo stares after him.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE WAR ROOOM - DAY\nWill, C.J. and Toby are seated at a very messy table. A young girl in a\nlow-cut shirt\nand short skirt enters, carrying a plastic trash bag. She picks up empty\ncoffee cups\nand food containers and puts them in the bag.\n\nMARINA\n[to Toby] Need any help with that?\n\nTOBY\nExcuse me?\n\nMARINA\nI compiled clippings over at Energy.\n\nTOBY\n[laughs in surprise] No, thank you, I've got it.\n\nShe leans in very close to Will to gather more trash.\n\nWILL\nSorry, we should have cleaned up the room yesterday.\n\nMARINA\nOh, no no. it's not a problem.\n\nLeo enters the room.\n\nLEO\nSo, where are we?\n\nTOBY\nDid you see the Post/ABC poll this morning?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nMARINA\nUm, excuse me? Do any of you know where the dumpsters are?\n\nNo one answers.\n\nMARINA\nYeah. It's okay. I'll find them. [leaves]\n\nLEO\nWho's that?\n\nTOBY\n[whispering] A walking lawsuit.\n\nC.J.\nWhere are we on the state dinner?\n\nLEO\nStill on for the schedule.\n\nC.J.\nExcept we don't have food, chefs, or help.\n\nLEO\nJosh is coordinating with the British. We still have another day before we\nhave to\ndecide.\n\nANGELA\n[entering] Any change?\n\nC.J.\nNot according to Time.\n\nLEO\nHow'd it go with the minority leader?\n\nANGELA\nStill got her for one more day but she's threatening to cut bait.\n\nWILL\nIf we lose her the House Dems will start lobbying the Speaker instead of us\nfor table\ncraps.\n\nTOBY\nAnd Haffley is running the government.\n\nLEO\nOkay. Today is the day. [to Will] Work the V.P. [to Angela] and the minority\nleader and\ncontact Haffley to make sure we can still get a deal at three percent.\n\nWILL\nWhat happened to trying for two percent?\n\nLEO\n12 hours passed, that's what happened. [to C.J.] Tell the speaker we're\ntaking their\ntemperature but the President isn't involved yet.\n\nTOBY\nAnd that has the rare quality of also being true.\n\nLEO\nI want a continuing resolution by the close of business.\n\nLeo stands and leaves the War Room.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPTIOL HILL HALLWAY - DAY\nSenator Royce and Speaker Haffley are walking down a corridor with various\naides.\n\nROYCE\nThey blinked?\n\nHAFFLEY\nYup. The Vice President is working with the minority leader. We're going to\nget a CR\ntoday.\n\nROYCE\nThe President's not on board yet.\n\nHAFFLEY\nThat's just a tactic, So Bartlet doesn't look weak.\n\nMAN\nThey're going to swallow three percent?\n\nHAFFLEY\nRight now they'd swallow five, but we're going to be magnanimous.\n\nROYCE\nWe're only 50 billion apart on the final budget. Why don't I call Russell,\nsuggest we\nskip the continuing resolution and cut a budget deal?\n\nHAFFLEY\nWe can get a much better deal on the budget if they sign our CR.\n\nROYCE\nThey caved, we won. How much more leverage do we need before we start\ngoverning again?\n\nHAFFLEY\nWe are governing. We're slowing the rate of federal spending increases,\nwe're stopping\nthis President from driving this country deeper into debt and leaving our\nchildren to\npay for it. We're doing what we told the voters we would do if they elected\nus!\n\nMAN\nCover of Time, huh?\n\nHaffley chuckles.\n\nCUT TO: INT. RESIDENCE STUDY - DAY\n\nBARTLET\n[forcefully] No!\n\nLEO\nIt's a good deal. Three percent on the CR, and we live to fight another day.\n\nBARTLET\nOne percent like we'd agreed.\n\nLEO\nSir, we're not going to get one percent. We need to get past this. Focus on\nthe future.\nHouse Democrats aren't gonna stick. They have to head home for the holidays\nand defend\nwhy we shut down the federal government...\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nLeo sighs and looks frustrated. Bartlet sits at his desk and continues\nworking.\n\nLEO\nSir? You're putting all our chips down on a single hand we can't win.\n\nBartlet slams his hand on the desk and takes off his glasses to look up at\nLeo.\n\nBARTLET\nWe had a deal, Leo.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\nJosh is working at his desk. The light bulb in his desk lamp blinks, then\ngoes out.\n\nJOSH\nWhoa.\n\nHe leans over to tap the bulb.\n\nMARINA\nNeed a new bulb?\n\nJosh looks up, startled. Marina is standing at the door to his office,\ntrash bag in\nher hand.\n\nJOSH\nSure, thanks. Rina, right?\n\nMARINA\nYeah, it's short for Marina.\n\nShe picks up empty containers from his desk.\n\nJOSH\nYou Greek?\n\nMARINA\nNo, I was born on a boat.\n\nJOSH\nHow'd you get here?\n\nMARINA\nBus.\n\nJOSH\nNo, I mean why weren't you laid off like everyone else?\n\nAs he speaks, Josh picks up his phone and hits a preset number.\n\nMARINA\nOh.

They stopped issuing\nhunting\nlicenses.\n\nJosh walks into the BULLPEN AREA to get more coffee.\n\nJOSH\nWhy'd you put social security on the list? It's an entitlement.\n\nDONNA\nYeah, but we sent home the people from the social security administration\nwho run the\nmachines that cut the checks.\n\nJOSH\nThe checks won't go out.\n\nDONNA\nNot unless we get the GAO to issue a ruling to bring those guys back in. What'd\nCounsel\nsay about the other thing?\n\nJOSH\nIt's considered coercion if you come back to work as a volunteer.\n\nDONNA\nOh, but it's not coercion to work on a cell phone and run to Kinko's every\nten minutes\nto send you faxes and emails?\n\nJOSH\nAARP considers you essential.\n\nDONNA\nWhen do you think I'll get my essential paycheck? Rent's due at the end of\nthe month.\n\nJOSH\nI'll lend you money.\n\nDONNA\nYeah, but wouldn't that just be emblematic of all these stop-gap continuing\nresolutions,\ntaking out a loan, begging for an extension rather than grappling with the\nhard reality\nof...\n\nJOSH\nYou're right. Get a cheaper apartment.\n\nDONNA\nI want to come in and do my job.\n\nJOSH\nTell me about it.\n\nDONNA\nStop being a baby and just go.

I made a call.\n\nWILL\nTo whom?\n\nLeo looks at C.J., who raises her eyebrows. C.J. glances at Toby, who glances\nat Will.\nC.J. and Toby look knowing.

When this is gone, I'm going to have to start in on the\ngrandkid's\nelbow macaroni.\n\nAbbey goes to the fridge and takes out a container of yogurt.\n\nABBEY\nYou sound stuffy.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, there's something going around. They said your motorcade arrived an\nhour ago.\nWhere you been?\n\nABBEY\nDownstairs, in your war room.\n\nBARTLET\nOh?\n\nABBEY\nWhich, I noticed, you were not in. What happened?

Did he go ahead and contract the leadership?\n\nABBEY\nDon't be so melodramatic. They don't understand what you want them to do. Do\nyou know\nwhat you want them to do?\n\nBartlet joins her at the table.\n\nBARTLET\nStaying through the holidays?\n\nABBEY\nDepends on how long it takes your damn government to get back up and running.\n\nThere's a pause while they eat.\n\nABBEY\nJed, where's Josh?\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY\nLeo walks down the hallway towards Josh's office. The hallways are nearly\nempty, as are\nthe bullpens. In the background, a phone rings, but no one answers. Leo\nsticks his head\nin JOSH'S OFFICE.

Josh still in there with Leo and\nAngela?\n\nTOBY\nOr maybe it's twelve or thirteen, I've lost count.\n\nC.J.\nToby, we've all been assuming this is the President not understanding what's\nreally\ngoing on. He's been so out of it since Zoey, you know, and we've all been\nprotecting\nhim, you, me, Leo. But what if it's something else?\n\nThey exit Toby's office and begin walking down the HALLWAY.\n\nTOBY\nIt's not.\n\nC.J.\nBut what if it is?\n\nTOBY\nRepublicans have us and they know it.

Toby walks into THE WAR ROOM,\nwhere Will,\nJosh, Leo, and Angela are arguing.\n\nJOSH\nThe President's already said that three percent is unacceptable.\n\nANGELA\nThat was three days ago!\n\nJOSH\nThree days, three years, it's still unacceptable!\n\nANGELA\nThe Speaker of the House was elected by 115,000 residents of Spokane,\nWashington. The\nPresident was elected by 51 million Americans.\n\nTOBY\nOne percent, three percent, five percent, the CR is nothing if we never get\naround to\npassing a budget!\n\nJOSH\nWe can use Royce...\n\nWILL\nRoyce is never going to take on Haffley and Haffley is convinced he's already\nwon. Only\nbecause we blinked! [angrily] Of course we blinked, we lost all meaningful\nsupport in\nCongress. And the public is blaming this mess on us. [lowers his voice]\nThe President\nis going to be down here any minute, Josh, I need unanimity, this is the\n\"come to\nJesus\" meeting.\n\nJosh looks past Leo and sees the President's silhouette on the door.\n\nBARTLET\nWho's coming to Jesus, Leo, me or you?\n\nEveryone says \"good morning, Mr. President\" as Bartlet enters the room.\n\nBARTLET\nThree percent. 60 days. [looks pensive]\n\nANGELA\nMr. President, it's a gift.\n\nBARTLET\nToby?\n\nTOBY\nPeople are frustrated with both parties.

It didn't.\n\nBARTLET\nJosh?\n\nHe looks at Leo, who looks back sternly, before answering.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do you want, Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nI want to be able to govern.\n\nANGELA\nOur bargaining position is weakening every day. There's a deal on the table,\nRepbulican\nleadership are in their conference room, waiting for our reply.\n\nJOSH\nLet's go up to the Hill to see them.\n\nTOBY\nWe can't go to the Hill. We'll look even more desperate.\n\nJOSH\nThe country's waiting for someone to step up. It should be us.\n\nLEO\nSir, if we go to Haffley's office it will set a dangerous precedent for\nfuture\nnegotiations.\n\nBARTLET\n[smiling at Josh] Let's go.\n\nLEO\nMr. President, you have a video conference with Admiral Vackey of Pac-com\nat 5:00.\n\nJosh puts on his jacket and follows Bartlet towards the door.\n\nBARTLET\nThen I suggest we get a move on.\n\nANGELA\nThey're leaving.\n\nLEO\nGo.\n\nShe grabs her purse and follows Josh and Bartlet.

They're closed today, too because of the shutdown. But if Congress\nhas their\nway, it will lose 40 percent of it's funding. I'd rather see it shut down\nfor a week\nthan for good.\n\nJOSH\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nExcuse me.\n\nJOSH\nThe Capitol is just a five or ten minute walk from here. Care to stretch\nyour legs?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry folks, I've got a meeting on the Hill.\n\nTOURIST\nYou go get them, Mr. President!\n\nBARTLET\nYou bet!

Three percent for 60 days, on a\ncontinuing\nresolution...\n\nBARTLET\n[interrupting] We're not doing another CR, Mr. Speaker.\n\nHAFFLEY\nThis room was designed to throw people off-balance.

That's why the Constitution put\nCongress in\ncharge of the budget.\n\nBARTLET\n[looking amused] And gave the President the veto. Fortunately, your Congress\nput\ntogether a budget. I understand more than 2000 people worked with interest\ngroups,\nunions, industry, and 535 elected officials to arrive at that 15,000 page\ndocument\nover there. [gestures to the huge budget appropriations bill at the other\nend of his\ndesk] All 14 appropriations bills, exactly as we left them four days ago. It\ntook us\nwhat, ten months to work out our differences on those bills.\n\nHAFFLEY\nWe still haven't cut enough spending.\n\nBARTLET\nI agree. I want you to cut agriculture subsidies, and you want me to cut\nMedicaid,\nagain. You know I'll veto any Medicaid cuts, and I know you won't give me any\nagriculture cuts. So, here we are.\n\nHAFFLEY\nThen we're back to a continuing resolution, sir, which I can probably pass\nwith a two\npercent...\n\nBARTLET\n[forcefully] No. We were 100 billion apart, and I met you halfway, at 50\nbillion.\nThen we were 50 billion apart, and I suspect if I'd gone down to 25, we'd\nbe 12\nbillion apart.\n\nHAFFELY\nA billion here, a billion there. We dole it out like candy to children. Welfare\n\npaternalism, regulation, taxes, and quotas are why people can't find jobs.\n\nBARTLET\nThis administration has created the greatest amount of wealth in history.\n\nHAFFLEY\nWhich is a testament to the resilience of the American spirit! Not Washington\nbureaucrats.\n\nBARTLET\nNot everyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps, Mr. Speaker.\n\nHAFFLEY\nI couldn't agree more. But the solution is for government to get off of\npeople's backs!\nWe could give every student in America 10,000 dollars a year, but instead,\nwe fund the\nDepartment of Education.\n\nBARTLET\n[angrily] You're not going to demonize the millions of selfless teachers\nand public\nservants who are...\n\nHAFFLEY\nThey're trapped in failed system! I can't stand by...\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I'm not going to negotiate with anyone who holds a gun to my head! We\nhad a deal!\nI don't care if my approval ratings drop into single digits. I am the\nPresident of the\nUnited States and I will leave this government shut down until we reach an\nequitable\nagreement!\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE WAR ROOM - DAY\nWill is sitting at the table with Josh, Toby, and Angela. They are all\nslouching in\ntheir chairs. No one is doing anything. All are bored and/or nervous as they\nwait for\nthe President's talk with Haffley to finish.\n\nWILL\nA hundred and ten minutes?\n\nTOBY\nCould mean anything.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a good thing.\n\nDonna enters the room.\n\nJOSH\nHey.\n\nDONNA\nDon't call the Feds. I'm just dropping off forms for the Treasury employees.\n\nANGELA\nSo you're the one who saved Social Security.\n\nWILL\nNice catch.\n\nDONNA\nThanks. I just wish... There's so much going on, I just wish I could help\nmore.\n\nJOSH\nYou hear about the NBA rookie who pulled his first rebound the night Wilt\nChamberlain\npulled 55?\n\nDONNA\nMm-mmm.\n\nJOSH\nSaid it was the proudest day of his life. Together he and Wilt went for 34\npoints\nand 56 rebounds.\n\nDONNA\nI pulled a rebound?\n\nJOSH\nYou pulled 11 million.\n\nDONNA\nI'm Wilt Chamberlain?\n\nJOSH\nNo, you're the rookie.\n\nTOBY\nIt is worth noting that Philadelphia lost that game.\n\nLeo enters the room.\n\nLEO\nHaffley just left.\n\nEveryone gets up and files out of the room.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nLeo opens the door and enters the room. Angela, Josh, Toby, C.J., and Will\nfollow.\nPresident Bartlet is seated at his desk, looking very serious.\n\nJOSH\nWhat did we get? Another continuing resolution?\n\nBartlet stands.\n\nBARTLET\nNo. [beat] A budget.\n\nHe looks pleased. Leo smiles.\n\nC.J.\nTheir cap gains tax cut?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nTOBY\nWhat about our college tuition tax credit?\n\nBARTLET\nNo, but it's a tax cut. Republicans are always in favor of tax cuts, so if\nwe can find\na way to make it revenue-neutral next year, it stays.\n\nToby pats Josh on the back.\n\nANGELA\nThe 50 billion gap?\n\nBARTLET\nWe'd already done our part, so the Speaker graciously agreed to do his.\n\nJOSH\nYee-ah!\n\nJosh and Toby hug. There's clapping, and everyone is smiling. Bartlet checks\nhis watch.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, Abbey says I have about five minutes before dinner. What's next?\n\nEveryone takes a seat on the couch as they begin talking. The camera pulls\nback.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.
