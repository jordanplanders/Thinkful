SHERATON CENTER HOTEL, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT\nThe camera pans up to Bartlet on a monitor. He is speaking in front of many\npeople.\n\nBARTLET\nI get nervous around laws that fundamentally assume that Americans can't be\ntrusted.\nWe'd better have mandatory sentencing, because judges can't be trusted to\ndisperse\neven-handed justice.\n\nThe crowd applauds.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SECLUDED AREA - CONTINUOUS\nToby and Sam are in a secluded area watching the speech on monitors. The\ncamera pans\nover Toby's shoulder to look down on a crowd. Bartlet is standing at the\npodium.\n\nBARTLET\nWe better have term limits, 'cause voters can't be trusted to recognize\ncorruption.\n\nThere's another round of applause from the crowd.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, and by the way... I say, by the way. When the playing field is leveled\nand the\nprocess is fair and open, it turns out we have term limits. They're called\nelections.\n\nMore applause. The camera pans through the crowd.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HOTEL PRESS AREA - CONTINUOUS\nC.J. is circulating the room full of reporters.\n\nCHRIS\nThe President ate his Wheaties this morning.\n\nC.J.\nAs a matter of fact, the President had a bowl of oatmeal this morning.

You're not going to want to miss this.\n\nThe crowd applauds again.\n\nREPORTER\nC.J., what is this? What's going on in there?\n\nC.J.\nThe President's going to throw his cap over the wall.\n\nREPORTER\nWhat does that mean?\n\nC.J.\nYou're about to find out.\n\nCUT TO: THE PODIUM - CONTINUOUS\n\nBARTLET\nMy father was very fond of the analogy of the Irish lads whose journey was\nblocked by\na brick wall, seemingly too high to scale. Throwing their caps over the wall,\nthe lads\nhad no choice but to follow. How many times in the great history of our\ncountry have\nwe come to a wall seemingly too high to scale only to throw our caps to the\nother side?\n\nFADE TO: INT. A DARK ROOM - NIGHT\nThe Senate Majority Leader is inside with his staff. Steve Onorato is watching\nBartlet\nfrom a TV screen.\n\nSENATOR\nThis was given to me by a constituent who read in Time Magazine that I like\nCognac.\nThe problem is, that this is Brandy and not Cognac. Anyone know the\ndifference?\n\nONORATO\nSenator?\n\nSECRETARY\nThe Cognac is supposed to come from the...\n\nSENATOR\n...The Cognac region of France. That's right.\n\nONORATO\nSenator?\n\nSENATOR\nSteve, sit down with us over here, would you? The man's not going to say\nanything we're\ninterested in.\n\nONORATO\nI think he is.\n\nSENATOR\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nONORATO\nListen.\n\nBARTLET\n[on T.V.] Tomorrow... tomorrow morning, we're going to begin to change the\nway elections\nare supervised in this country.\n\nONORATO\nHe's going to name two finance reformers to the F.E.C.\n\nSENATOR\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\n\nONORATO\nListen.\n\nSENATOR\nYou said it wasn't going to happen.\n\nONORATO\nI was wrong.\n\nSENATOR\nYou were wrong?\n\nONORATO\nHe's going to name... damn it! Somebody....\n\nSECRETARY\nJohn Bacon...\n\nONORATO\nJohn Bacon and Patty Calhoun.\n\nSENATOR\nYou told him, they take on campaign finance reform, I roll out a legislative\nagenda\nthat'll make his boss sit down and cry.\n\nONORATO\nI made it very clear.\n\nBARTLET\n[on T.V.] I am proud to nominate John Branford Bacon and Patricia Calhoun\nto the\nFederal Election Commission.\n\nSENATOR\nGet him on the phone.\n\nSECRETARY\nWho?\n\nSENATOR\nJosh Lyman. Get him on the phone. I'm going to reach down his throat and\ntake out his\nlungs with an ice-cream scoop.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

[hands him the cell phone]\n\nTOBY\nJosh, if you need us, we're standing right here.\n\nJosh turns away to answer the call.\n\nJOSH\n[into phone] Hi, Senator. Why don't you take your legislative agenda and\nshove it up\nyour ass.\n\nHe closes the phone as the crowd applauds again.

THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT\nC.J. is fielding questions from a roomful of reporters. They are all clamoring\nfor C.J.\n\nREPORTER\nC.J.? Is the White House concerned that the FEC will become a partisan\npolitical football?\n\nC.J.\nI'd like to emphasize again that the President has nominated one Democrat\nand one\nRepublican, which he was, certainly, under no legal obligation to do.\n\nThere's more clamoring.\n\nC.J.\nJesse.\n\nJESSE\nIn the past, the F.E.C. Commissioners were chosen...\n\nC.J.\nIn the past, the F.E.C. Commissioners has been chosen by the President,\nsigning off on\nwhomever the Congressional Leadership pointed to.\n\nSTEVE\nWas the Congressional Leadership aware in advance that the President would\nbe slipping\nthis announcement in his speech tonight?\n\nC.J.\nI think it's possible we forgot to tell them.\n\nREPORTER\nC.J., is the President declaring war on Congress?\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nJosh is watching the press conference on TV.\n\nJOSH\nSay it's a police action.\n\nC.J.\n[on T.V.] The President isn't empowered to declare war.

[pause, looks]\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nJoey Lucas.\n\nDONNA\nShe's coming out with Kiefer tomorrow.\n\nJOSH\nOkay... okay....\n\nDONNA\nBy the way, that's what I was afraid to tell you.\n\nJOSH\nYou... you shouldn't have been.

But that's not what I was going to say.\n\nDONNA\nWhat were you going to say?\n\nJOSH\nThat's what I was going to say.\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nBut, both those things are true.

Sam is typing at his desk. Toby is standing looking\nover Sam's\nshoulder. Josh shuts the door and sits on a chair.\n\nJOSH\nHey.\n\nTOBY\n[to Josh] Hang on. [to Sam] That's good... good... Okay... Sam?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nYou're going to come to a verb soon, right?\n\nSAM\nOkay. You know what this is called?\n\nTOBY\nBad writing?\n\nSAM\nImagery.\n\nTOBY\nWell, you say potato... Josh, it's a big polling week. I'm bringing in Al\nKiefer.\n\nJOSH\nYou've turned 180 degrees on Kiefer. You know that?\n\nTOBY\nI haven't turned on Kiefer at all. I don't want him advising the President. I\nwant him\nbringing us numbers.\n\nJOSH\nAdvising people is what pollsters do.\n\nTOBY\nHe'll do what I tell him to do. Also....\n\nJOSH\nEnglish as the National Language.\n\nSAM\nThat's the first thing they're going to fight back with, Josh.\n\nTOBY\nWe need Hispanics. You know what state has a large population of Hispanics?\n\nJOSH\nUh... I want to say Maine, but uh...\n\nTOBY\nCalifornia.\n\nJOSH\nCalifornia. Damn, and I was only off by a continent.\n\nTOBY\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nIt's fine. Bring her out here.\n\nTOBY\nShe'll be here tomorrow.\n\nJOSH\nThis isn't a thing.\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\nI met her twice, Toby.\n\nSAM\nYeah, but, one of those times, she broke your heart. You know the way women\ncan do.\nWhere they take your heart and they throw it on the floor and then they\nstomp on it\nwith their big high heals. She's a very beautiful and interesting woman. I\ncan see why\na lot of guys would go for her. [pause] You know, there's nothing at all\nI'm saying now\nof any value. So, I think the thing to do is... I think I should just keep\nwriting.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. [gets up] We had a good night.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\n[at the door] C.J.'s doing great in there.\n\nHe leaves.

BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe press clamors for C.J.\n\nC.J.\nI'm going to take one more question. Katie.\n\nKATIE\nThe Federal Elections Commission's role has never been that much more than\nsymbolic...\n\nC.J.\nI wouldn't say the F.E.C. was merely symbolic, but if you're suggesting\nthey're\ntoothless, I'll agree with you.\n\nKATIE\nGiven that, does the White House think that two new commissioners will make\nany\ndifference?\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nKATIE\nThen why do it?\n\nC.J.\nSymbolism. There'll be plenty more tomorrow. Everybody have a good night.\n\nThe reporters clamor for C.J. but she heads off to Carol near the door.\n\nC.J.\nCarol.\n\nShe whispers. Carol walks to a reporter, JACK, who is sitting in front of\nDanny.\n\nCAROL\nJack, C.J.'s inviting you back to follow up on a couple of things.\n\nJACK\nMe?\n\nCAROL\nYeah.\n\nJACK\nShe doesn't want me.

[reaches for the phone] I'm gonna\ncall the\nSenator and I'm gonna tell him that he can shove his legislative agenda up\nhis ass!\n\nToby and Josh try to restrain the phone from Sam.\n\nJOSH\nI've already done that.\n\nSAM\nI'll do it again.\n\nJOSH\nYou know what this is like? This is like The Godfather. When Pacino tells\nJames Caan\nthat he's gonna kill the cop. It's a lot like that scene, only not really.\n\nTOBY\nDid Leo go home?\n\nJOSH\nHe's... he's still here somewhere.\n\nSAM\nHe's in the Residence.\n\nJOSH\nIt is like that scene. I'm James Caan. [to Sam] You're...you're Al Pacino.\n\nTOBY\nLet's go.\n\nJOSH\nToby, you're the guy who shows Pacino how to make tomato sauce.\n\nTOBY\n[to Sam] Let's go.\n\nThey all leave JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nJOSH\nI'll be right behind, I'm gonna pick up the late wires.\n\nHe pauses and stares down the hall toward JOEY'S OFFICE. He enters while\nhiding\nsomething behind his back.\n\nJOSH\nHello.\n\nJOEY\nHi.\n\nJOSH\nHey, Kenny.\n\nKENNY\nHey, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nI saw the light was on. You guys are here late.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI wanted to give you first look analysis in the morning. There's really some\ndecent\nmodels in Marin County and the Bay Area. But San Jose is a mess and so is\nOrange County,\nLong Beach, Anaheim, and San Diego.\n\nJOSH\nI brought you a coffee mug.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\nJust as a thing, cause you don't know anybody. It's got... uh... a picture\nof the White\nHouse. It says, 'The White House.' Seal of the President. It's a White House\ncoffee mug.\n\nJOEY\nThank you.\n\nJOSH\nKenny, can you give us a second?\n\nKENNY\nOh, sure. [signing to Joey] I'm going to step outside. [walks away]\n\nJOSH\nI wore this suit, special today. This isn't my regular Tuesday suit.\n\nJOEY\nYou have a regular Tuesday suit?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nJOEY\nFor me?\n\nJOSH\nYeah... So... Okay, I gotta go. [smiles wide as Josh leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nLeo is sitting next to the President's bed.\n\nLEO\nSo... I don't want to be Labor the point, though. I... I do think this is\nunderstandable.\nI feel a little self-conscience coming down the mountain on drugs two months\nafter I\nannounce I was a recovering drug addict. What do you think?\n\nBARTLET\nAbout what?\n\nLEO\nWhat I just said.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I wasn't listening to a lot of it.\n\nLEO\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, if there's anyone qualified to talk about the benefits of treatment\nvs. criminal\naction, it's you. Is there anyone whose life would be better right now,\nif you'd had\ngone to jail instead of rehab?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you. Is there anything else?\n\nSomeone knocks.\n\nBARTLET\nApparently there is.\n\nC.J.\n[enters] Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry. I heard Leo was here, I assumed you were awake.\n\nBARTLET\nI am.\n\nC.J.\nI haven't seen you all day, I just... wanted to apologize for the gaffe at\nthe briefing\nlast night.\n\nBARTLET\nYou fixed it this afternoon, right?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nThen let's move on.\n\nC.J.\nI do apologize, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nNo need to apologize, but I accept your apology and now I'm ready, if not\neager, to\nmove on.\n\nThere's another knock. Sam and Toby enter.\n\nSAM\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nHow you doin'?\n\nSAM\nYou were sleeping?\n\nBARTLET\nNot for a little while now.\n\nSAM\nThis is... I say, this is great, Mr. President, because usually you have a\nhard time\ngetting to sleep before one or two.\n\nBARTLET\nNot tonight.\n\nSAM\nThat's got to feel good.\n\nBARTLET\nGuys, let me tell you what I would like to have happen, right now.\n\nJOSH\n[enters] Good evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nJosh walking in the door wasn't even close.\n\nJOSH\nHow you doing, tonight?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm fine, thanks. How you doing?\n\nJOSH\nGood! I gave Joey Lucas a coffee mug. She doesn't know anybody here and\nshe's already\nworking hard. She's very committed. I think I did the right thing.\n\nBARTLET\nSee, the part I don't understand is, I got like, 24 armed guards right\noutside my\nbedroom door...\n\nSAM\nMr. President, after a day of meetings, are you any closer to a decision on\ndrugs?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm a day closer. There'll be more meetings tomorrow. In the meantime,\neverybody calm\ndown. Leo's got your engines fired like you're running Daytona. That's\nfine. Keep them\nthere. Guess what? Mistakes are gonna be made. Minimize them, fix them,\nmove on. Kiefer's\nnumbers got you scared? Listen to me. I have never lost an election in my\nlife. We do\nthis right, people are going to respond. You all had a good day.\n\nJOSH\nWe should go and leave you now.\n\nBARTLET\nYou guys should feel free to do this when my wife is here.\n\nAll chuckle.\n\nSAM\nSir, something has come up and frankly, it's got me as hot as a\npistol. Apparently....\n\nJOSH\nSam.\n\nSAM\nWe can talk about this tomorrow.\n\nBARTLET\nEverybody. Mandy was doing her job. It's time to let her out of the doghouse.\n\nLEO\nThat's me.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Leo] She was doing her job. C.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nSo was Danny.\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nGood night.\n\nEveryone says their good nights. Sam, Josh, and C.J. leave.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWe were almost done.\n\nTOBY\nI... met with Congresswoman Wyatt today.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?\n\nTOBY\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nSometimes I call my wife, Dr. Bartlet.\n\nTOBY\nI call her Andy or uh... Andrea.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nTOBY\nMandatory Minimums.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're whupped, my friend.\n\nTOBY\nSir.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, she's been talking to your for a year about Mandatory Minimums. You've\nbeen saying\nno. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family.\n\nTOBY\nYou call your wife 'Dr. Bartlet'?\n\nBARTLET\nJust for the turn-on.\n\nLeo smirks.\n\nTOBY\nUh... the thing is, she's right.\n\nBARTLET\nAndy.\n\nTOBY\nMandatory Minimums are considerably higher for crack than for powder cocaine.\n\nBARTLET\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nThe vast majority of crack users are black. The vast majority of drug users\nare white.\nThe Mandatory Minimums are racist.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, they are.\n\nTOBY\nIt should be part of the discussion.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd it will be.\n\nTOBY\nGood... uh... good night.\n\nBARTLET AND LEO\nGood night.\n\nToby leaves.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Leo] I'm sleeping better. [beat] When I sleep, I dream about a great\ndiscussion\nwith experts and ideas and diction and energy and honesty. And when I wake\nup, I think,\n\"I can sell that.\"\n\nLEO\nGood night, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nGood night.\n\nLeo shuts off the room lights and closes the doors. Bartlet shuts off his\nbed lamp and\ngoes back to bed.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\nOpening shot of a clock on the wall: 7:05. The camera pans down to Donna\nand Josh\nwalking through.\n\nDONNA\nThey got to start the poll, Josh. It's 7:05.\n\nJOSH\nIt's ten to seven.\n\nDONNA\nNo, it's really not.\n\nJOSH\nIt's 7:05?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nThat's ridiculous.\n\nDONNA\nI'm not making it up.\n\nJOSH\nMy watch says ten to seven.\n\nDONNA\nThat's 'cause your watch sucks.\n\nJOSH\nMy watch is fine.\n\nDONNA\nYour watch says ten to seven.\n\nJOSH\nHow do I know it isn't ten to seven?\n\nDONNA\n'Cause those large clocks on the wall that are run by the U.S. Navy, say\nyour watch\nsucks. In fact, they say your watch sucks in four different time zones.\n\nJosh and Donna pass by C.J.'S OFFICE. Toby is razzing C.J.\n\nTOBY\nQuestion six is asymmetrical.\n\nC.J.\nQuestion six is fine.\n\nTOBY\n\"Would you say things in this country are going in the right direction or\ndo you think\nthey've gotten off on the wrong track?\"\n\nJosh and Donna double back to C.J.'S office and stand at the door.\n\nJOSH\nHe's got a good point about this.\n\nC.J.\nNo, he doesn't.\n\nDONNA\nGuys, you know it's five after seven.\n\nTOBY\nShould be right direction or wrong direction.\n\nC.J.\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nDirection and track are two different words!\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Funk and Wagnall's.\n\nThey all leave C.J.'s office. Bonnie and Ginger are with them.\n\nTOBY\nWhat'd she call me?\n\nGINGER\nFunk and Wagnall's. They make the dictionary.\n\nTOBY\nI know who Funk and Wagnall's are.\n\nBONNIE\nThey why'd you ask her?\n\nEveryone starts heading out into the HALLWAY.\n\nDONNA\nGuys, it's five after seven.\n\nTOBY\nThe question is asymmetrical.\n\nC.J.\nThat may be so, but the question originated 2 decades ago and has proven to\nbe a\nconsistent predictor of a voter's potential behavior. So it stays the way\nit is.\n\nJOSH\nI have a problem with fourteen.\n\nC.J.\nWhat's your problem?\n\nJOSH\n\"When making policy decisions, do you think that President Bartlet puts the\nneeds of\naverage people first?\" \"Average people\" is a pejorative phrase and occurs\nabout six\ntimes in the polling model.\n\nC.J.\nThis may come as a shock to you, but 80% of the people in this country would\nuse the\nword \"average\" to describe themselves. They do not find the term\ndeprecating. Indeed,\nbeing considered an \"average American\" is something they find to be positive\nand\ncomforting.\n\nThey all walk into THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Leo, Larry, Ed and several other\nstaffers are\ninside. Leo is reading a piece of paper. Toby sits next to him.\n\nLEO\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nLEO\n[reads] \"Jed Bartlet cares about people like me.\"\n\nC.J.\nLeo, we went over this.\n\nTOBY\nWe need to talk about the asymmetry of question six.\n\nC.J.\nWe really don't.\n\nTOBY\nSince when are you an expert on language?\n\nC.J.\nIn polling models?\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\n1993. Since when are you an uptight pain in the ass?\n\nTOBY\nSince long before that.\n\nLEO\n\"Jed Bartlet cares about people like me. Agree or disagree?\"\n\nC.J.\nAgain, we went over this.\n\nLEO\nCan't \"people like me\", when read off the script, be taken to mean people\nlike the\ninterviewer?\n\nED\nWhen we ask that question, we usually say, \"People like yourself.\"\n\nLARRY\nOr \"people like you.\"\n\nED\nI've seen it both ways.\n\nLEO\nFellas.\n\nLARRY\n\"Yourself\" is a little softer.\n\nED\nAnd softer is bad?\n\nLARRY\nSofter is better.\n\nLEO\nBut the point is....\n\nC.J.\nThe respondent isn't confused by the question and separating the respondent\nfrom the\ninterviewer with \"people like yourself\" is pejorative. So, Ed, Larry, you\ncan take this\nup with Josh. Leo, Eastern Standard Time is sitting down to dinner. The poll\nis fine.\n\nJOSH\nIt's an important poll, C.J.\n\nC.J.\nI'm aware of its importance. I'm also aware that if we don't start the phone\nbanks\nright now, I might not have enough time to leak the internals to media\noutlets before\nwe hit the weekend.\n\nTOBY\nThere's still the matter...\n\nC.J.\nSo, it turns out that over the last 3 weeks we managed to climb out of the\nhole, only\nwe can't tell anybody about it 'til Monday, cause we stood here all night\narguing about\nasymmetry! [sighs] It's time.\n\nLEO\nAnybody want to make a prediction?\n\nED\nWe'll hold at 42% job approval.\n\nLARRY\nWe'll hold steady.\n\nJOSH\nI'll be happy if we hold steady.\n\nTOBY\nWe'll drop a few points, but it'll be inside the plus or minus.\n\nLEO\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nWe're going to go up five points.\n\nLEO\nThe President thinks we're going to hold steady.\n\nC.J.\nThe President is wrong.\n\nLEO\nYou think?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nLEO\nLet's find out. Toby, tell Sam to start the banks.\n\nToby picks up the phone and pushes a button.\n\nCUT TO: INT. PHONE BANKS - NIGHT\nSam and Mandy are standing wait. Sam's cell phone rings.\n\nSAM\n[into phone] Sam Seaborn... Okay. [to Mandy] Let's get our report card.\n\nMandy walks inside the phone bank area.\n\nMANDY\nOkay!

Ginger and Bonnie are inside.\n\nGINGER\nHey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nHey, Ginger.\n\nBONNIE\nHow's it going in there?\n\nSAM\nI popped Mandy with my tranquilizer gun. She's doing fine.\n\nGINGER\nBonnie wanted to know why it takes 48 hours.\n\nSAM\nWe need 1500 responses.\n\nBONNIE\nIt takes 30 people, 48 hours to make 1500 calls?\n\nSAM\nIt takes them about 12 hours to make 1500 calls. We need 1500 responses,\nwhich means\nwe need to make 6000 calls.\n\nTOBY\n[enters] Sam.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nBONNIE\nOnly 1 in 4 people don't hang up?\n\nSAM\nThat's if you're lucky.\n\nToby and Sam enter TOBY'S OFFICE. Sam shuts the door.\n\nTOBY\nThe G.W.

They know she's graduating Law School\ntomorrow. They know\nit's someplace you'll likely to be. Maybe they'll want to snap a\npicture. Maybe...\n\nSAM\nLaurie.\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nYou called her \"this girl.\"\n\nTOBY\nSam, you can't.\n\nSAM\nI said okay, Toby. Do you see me arguing with you?\n\nTOBY\nNo.\n\nSAM\nAnything else?\n\nTOBY\nNope.\n\nSAM\nBiggest day of her life. Huge day. She put herself through Law School and\nI know that\nthere are people in South Carolina that don't like how she did it.\n\nTOBY\nNot just South Carolina, Sam.\n\nSAM\nThen in both Carolinas, Toby. Though, I never understood what the hell\nbusiness it is...\n\nTOBY\nYou can't go, Sam.\n\nSAM\nI'm not going.\n\nTOBY\nThank you.\n\nSam leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nMargaret comes in and closes the door.

Why do you want me to wait in here?\n\nLEO\nCause I do.\n\nMARGARET\nOkay. [waits a little] It feels weird not doing anything.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nMARGARET waits a bit longer, looking around the room.\n\nMARGARET\nIt feels weird, you know, 'cause the instinct...\n\nLEO\nOkay! Go out and send him in.\n\nMARGARET\nOkay. [leaves]\n\nLeo gets up to greet his guest, BARRY HASKEL.\n\nLEO\nBarry.\n\nBARRY HASKEL\nYes.\n\nLEO\nLeo McGarry.\n\nBARRY\nBarry Haskel.\n\nLEO\nGood to meet you.\n\nBARRY\nMm-hmm.\n\nLEO\nIs this your first time in the White House?\n\nBARRY\nThis is my first time in the West Wing.\n\nLEO\nYou've been on the Federal Election Commission for nine years and no one\nhas ever invited\nyou to the White House?\n\nBARRY\nNot to the West Wing. There have been... I go to the annual Christmas party\nat the O.E.O.B.\nand the last Christmas the Vice President stopped in for a moment and it\nwas very nice.\n\nLEO\nBarry. [motions for Barry to sit]\n\nBARRY\nMm-hmm. [sits down]\n\nLEO\nI wanted to talk to you about Campaign Finance Reform and specifically soft\nmoney\ncontributions.\n\nBARRY\nRight. I had a hunch. Could I possibly have a glass of fruit juice?\n\nLEO\nAre you thirsty?\n\nBARRY\nI'll be perfectly honest, Mr. McGarry. This is the first time I've been\ncalled to the\noffice of the White House Chief of Staff.\n\nLEO\nYou're a little nervous.\n\nBARRY\nYou know you walk past a dress Marine when you come in here?\n\nLEO\nRodney.\n\nBARRY\nI didn't catch his name, but...\n\nLEO\nRodney's great. [calls] Rodney!\n\nRODNEY\n[enters] Yes, Mr. McGarry.\n\nLEO\nCould you do that thing you were doing before?\n\nBarry raises a hand to decline. Rodney goes through a little drill with his\nrifle, ending\nwith a loud thump that makes Barry jump a little.\n\nLEO\nThanks, Rodney.\n\nRODNEY\nAnytime sir. [leaves]\n\nLEO\nIt's amazing, and that rifle's really loaded, too.\n\nBARRY\nMr. McGarry.\n\nLEO\nCall me Leo.\n\nBARRY\nLeo.\n\nLEO\nThere's no need to be nervous, Barry. We know you're one of us.\n\nBARRY\nI'm sorry?\n\nLEO\nI say, we know you're one of us. Six Commissioners on the F.E.C. Two just\nresigned, leaving\nfour, including you. The belief has always been that none of the four of\nyou favor a ban on\nsoft money contributions. But the truth is, you do.\n\nBARRY\nThat's not true.\n\nLEO\nYes, it is. And the way that I know that it is is cause you said so. You\nsaid so to the\nNewark Star Ledger on March 13, 1995, \"Money isn't speech.\" And you said so\ntwo years before\nthat to the Detroit Free Press, \"We must reverse the 1978 Regulatory decision\nallowing soft\nmoney.\"\n\nBARRY\nThose quotes were anonymous.\n\nLEO\nNot anymore.\n\nBARRY\nI gave those quotes on the condition of anonymity.\n\nLEO\nHey, I know how you feel. I went to drug rehab on the condition of\nanonymity. Maybe you\nread about it in the papers.\n\nBARRY\nLook.\n\nLEO\nBarry, Barry! You want to ban soft money. You're one of us. You've been outed.\n\nBARRY\nIt never made much... being out numbered 5 to 1 on the F.E.C.... it never\nmade much sense\nto me to swim against the grain. I would've been...\n\nLEO\nI understand.\n\nBARRY\nI would've been irrelevant. It made...\n\nLEO\nPlus, you would've had a hard time getting re-upped by the Senate when your\nterm expired.\n\nBARRY\nExactly!\n\nLEO\nOn the other hand, if we hadn't gone out and found ya, you probably never\nwould have been\ninvited to the White House.\n\nBARRY\nSee now... when I got the call from your office, my wife and her friends\nsaid this is what\nwas going to happen.\n\nLEO\nWhat's that?\n\nBARRY\nThat you were going to use the trappings of the White House. That there was\ngoing to be a\nsort of, um... intimidation.\n\nLEO\nNo one's intimidating you, Barry. You're with us. You were wandering for\nyears in the\ndarkness, but we came and found ya. And welcome back to the pack.\n\nBARRY\nCoercion, then? And I notice that I'm sitting here, in the Chief of Staff's\noffice and with\nall the trappings of the White House...\n\nLEO\n[chuckling] Barry.\n\nBARRY\n...and my wife and her friends say it's not uncommon for people to get\nlight-headed, and\nstar struck, and I've heard the same thing from other people.\n\nLEO\nNonsense. Let me show you around the place. [gets up from his chair]\n\nBARRY\nIf I could just get a glass of water.\n\nLEO\nNo problem, we keep it in here.\n\nLeo opens door to THE OVAL OFFICE. He and Barry enter. Bartlet is with some\nguests and\nthey're all sharing a good laugh.\n\nLEO\nMr. President, I'm so sorry to interrupt.\n\nBARTLET\nNot at all, we're just having a nightcap.\n\nLEO\nI'd like you to meet Barry Haskell from the F.E.C.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, may I present Treasury Secretary, Kenneth...\n\nKENNETH\nKen Kato, how are you?\n\nBARTLET\nMr. Attorney General.\n\nDAN\nDan Larson.\n\nBARTLET\nOur CIA Director, Rob Conrad.\n\nROB\nIt's good to see you.\n\nThey each shake hands with Barry.\n\nBARTLET\nBarry, I'm Jed Bartlet. I understand you're thinking about helping us out. It\nmakes me\nso happy. [shakes Barry's hand]\n\nBARRY\nIt's an honor to meet you, Sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, let's get him a drink.\n\nBarry tries to wave off the offer.\n\nLEO\n[to Barry] They'll take good care of you. [turns to go back to his office]\n\nBARTLET\nLeo... [walks towards Leo]\n\nROB [OS]\nCome on, sit down and have a drink with us.\n\nBartlet and Leo stand near the door, whispering.\n\nLEO\nJust put him in the boat.\n\nBARTLET\nThis could all be for nothing.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nI mean, if the numbers... [points downward]\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nDid we start?\n\nLEO\nWe put the polling in the field 3 hours ago.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. Did the guys make any predictions?\n\nLEO\nNo, I didn't ask.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, you did.\n\nLEO\nThey think we're going to hold at 42. Toby thinks we drop a few points but\ninside the margin.\n\nBARTLET\nIt could be worse.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nI mean it could be worse than holding at 42.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\n'Cause if these numbers keep going down, I'm just a guy with Barry Haskell\nin his office.\n\nLEO\nI'll stop back in ten minutes.\n\nBARTLET\nA dress Marine guarding your door?\n\nLEO\nToo showy?\n\nBARTLET\nNah... My thing is, what's he suppose to be guarding right now?\n\nLEO\nI'll be right in here. [points to his office]\n\nBARTLET\nThanks.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President. [heads back into his office]\n\nCUT TO: INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT\nWe see Laurie and her friend, JANEANE, sitting at a long table with books\nscattered about.\n\nJANEANE\nYou are graduating tomorrow and...\n\nLAURIE\nShhhhh...\n\nJANEANE\n[lowers voice] You're graduating tomorrow...\n\nLAURIE\nJaneane.\n\nJANEANE\n...and yet, you're in a library studying.\n\nLAURIE\nThere's something called the Bar Exam.\n\nJANEANE\nOh, are you taking it tonight?\n\nLAURIE\nNo...\n\nJANEANE\nWell, then let's go out.\n\nLAURIE\nJust give me ten more minutes.\n\nA cell phone rings.\n\nJANEANE\nOh god, is that me?\n\nLAURIE\nThat's me.

Listen...\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I was asking...\n\nC.J.\nThe White House is committed to reversing the devastating affects of drug\nabuse in our\nsociety. We believe the best way to do that is to treat drug addiction as\nwhat the AMA\nhas said it is, which is a medical problem.

But for\nthe moment, I think there's no danger in the White House standing by Sam\nand aggressively\ngoing after the people who set him up.\n\nSam looks at Toby a bit stunned.\n\nBARTLET\n[big sigh] Sam, you're going to spend the morning in the White House Counsel's\noffice\nfinding out if you've broke any laws.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou should also call the girl... what's her name?\n\nSAM\nLaurie.\n\nBARTLET\nYou should call her and tell her the White House deeply regrets the phenomenal\ninconvenience\nshe's about to experience.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou might also want to point out to her that she probably has a cause of\naction against\nthe paper.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd you should tell her that if she passes her Bar exam, the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral will\npersonally see to it that she's admitted to the Bar.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nTell her the President of the United States says congratulations on getting\nher degree.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's all.\n\nSAM\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nSam, still stunned beyond belief, leaves THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's nice when we can do something for prostitutes once in a while, isn't it?\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nCHARLIE\n[enters] Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nAre we ready to go?\n\nCHARLIE\nAmbassador Cochran's in the Mural room and Ted Mitchell's waiting outside.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere are we putting Lobell and his people?\n\nCHARLIE\nIn the Roosevelt room.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's going to have a lot of staff with him.\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't know what any of them do, but there they are where ever Lobell goes,\n14-15 guys....\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm going to take care of this first and I'll see you across the hall.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, Mr. President. [leaves]\n\nBARTLET\nWho's in the Mural room?\n\nCHARLIE\nKen Cochran.\n\nBARTLET\nYou did it again.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm sorry, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nWhen you said the name 'Cochran', it was like you knew him.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI have a sense about these things.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nA finely honed sense.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's failing you at the moment, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nCochran's in the Mural room?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy don't you go sit with him and send in Ted Mitchell.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nSECRETARY\n[enters] Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, of course. [takes a pen and signs something] Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY\nThank you, sir.\n\nShe leaves as TED MITCHELL enters.\n\nBARTLET\nTed.\n\nTED MITCHELL\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you for coming.\n\nThey hug.\n\nTED\nOh, it's my pleasure.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're looking good.\n\nTED\nOh, I feel good.\n\nBARTLET\nHow is Mary?\n\nTED\nShe sends her love. [sits down]\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, listen. I have something to do in the next room. Let me just tell\nyou that\nI need a favor.\n\nTED\nOh, of course, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI need you to hire a guy.\n\nTED\nWho, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nA former ambassador to Bulgaria.\n\nTED\nWho is that, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nKen Cochran.\n\nTED\nWell, isn't Ken Cochran the current ambassador to Bulgaria?\n\nBARTLET\nNot for long. Look, he's a good man, a smart man; I think he'd make a very\ngood corporate\nofficer.\n\nTED\nWhy is he being fired, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nGross incompetence. I'll be right back.\n\nHe leaves a confused Ted sitting in the Office.\n\nBartlet walks through the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Nancy walks in.\n\nNANCY\nGood morning, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nGood morning, Nancy.\n\nNANCY\nSenator Lobell's in the Roosevelt room.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I'll be right in.\n\nHe opens the door to THE MURAL ROOM. KEN COCHRAN and Charlie had been waiting\ninside.\n\nKEN COCHRAN\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nKen.\n\nThey shake hands.\n\nCOCHRAN\nIt's good to see you again, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you for flying in on such short notice.\n\nCOCHRAN\nOf course, Mr. President. What can I do for you?\n\nBARTLET\nResign.\n\nCOCHRAN\nExcuse me?\n\nBARTLET\nYou've been having an affair with the daughter of the Prime Minister and\nthat doesn't\nwork for me. But neither does the newspaper article saying you're having an\naffair with\nthe daughter of the Prime Minister. So, I need you to resign. You're going\nto get a job\noffer from Ted Mitchell for a lot more money than you're making now, that's\nwhy you left\nthe Embassy. I'll be back in a minute.\n\nBartlet leaves. Charlie closes the door.\n\nCOCHRAN\nWell, this is outrageous.\n\nHe wipes his face and hands nervously with a handkerchief.\n\nCOCHRAN\nThis is outrageous and I'll explain that to him when he comes back in here.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nHave we met?\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nCOCHRAN\nYou look very familiar to me. Have we met?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nWhere?\n\nCHARLIE\nI was a waiter at the Gramercy club.\n\nCOCHRAN\nCharlie?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nCharlie!\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nIt's good to see you again. [goes to shake Charlie's hand]\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nUnder strange circumstances, which when the President comes back, I'll\nexplain....\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nI resigned my membership in that club, by the way.\n\nCHARLIE\nDid you?\n\nCOCHRAN\nOh yeah. I find exclusive clubs to be repugnant.\n\nCHARLIE\nI couldn't help but notice that didn't stop you from joining up in the first\nplace.\n\nCOCHRAN\nNow, that's out of line. That's out of line and that shouldn't have been\nsaid. And you've\nforgotten that you're addressing an U.S. Ambassador.\n\nCHARLIE\nI apologize, sir.\n\nCOCHRAN\nI'm sorry to do this, but I'd like to speak to your supervisor.\n\nCHARLIE\n[looking perplexed] Well, I'm personal aide to the President, so my\nsupervisor's a little\nbusy right now looking for a back door to this place to shove you out of. But,\nI'll let\nhim know you'd like to lodge a complaint.\n\nBARTLET\n[comes back in] Thanks for waiting.\n\nCOCHRAN\nMr. President. Clearly this young man, who works for you, has told you\nsomething about\nour past, and I'd like to say here and now...\n\nBARTLET\nIt doesn't have anything to do with... Oh, wait a second. You two have a past?\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nYou mocked my finely honed sense.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou stood there in my face...\n\nCOCHRAN\nSir.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's done Ken. Ted Mitchell's going to put you on the Board of Directors,\nand please\nremember that I have a lot of affection for your wife, and I would hate to\nsee her be\nmade a fool of.\n\nCOCHRAN\nI think it would be appropriate at this time, Mr. President, to make a\nconfession.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's that?\n\nCOCHRAN\n[smuggly] I never voted for you.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, thanks for trying, but here I am anyway. Got to go.\n\nBartlet leaves into the HALLWAY. He heads for THE ROOSEVELT ROOM, where Toby\nis waiting\noutside.\n\nTOBY\nAll set?\n\nBARTLET\nLook at that. 14 staffers in there.\n\nTOBY\nYou have quite a huge staff, too, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, but I don't walk around with them, you know?\n\nBoth enter. MAX LOBELL is waiting inside with a number of his staffers.\n\nBARTLET\nGood morning.\n\nMAX LOBELL\nGood morning, Mr. President. Please allow me to introduce Bob Simon, Peter\nRapman....\n\nBARTLET\nMax, I don't need to know all the names. It's okay. Please, sit down.\n\nLOBELL\nAll right then.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know what we're doing here, right?\n\nLOBELL\nWe're going to talk about soft money.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're going to do more than talk about it.\n\nLOBELL\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nWe agree on nothing, Max.\n\nLOBELL\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nEducation, guns, drugs, school prayer, gays, defense spending, taxes, you\nname it,\nwe disagree.\n\nLOBELL\nYou know why?\n\nBARTLET\n'Cause I'm a lily-livered, bleeding-heart, liberal, egg head, communist.\n\nLOBELL\nYes, sir. And I'm a gun-totin', redneck son-of-a-bitch.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, you are.\n\nLOBELL\nWe agree on that.\n\nBARTLET\nWe also agree on campaign finance.\n\nLOBELL\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nSo, Max.\n\nLOBELL\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nLet's work together on campaign finance.\n\nLOBELL\nYou don't have the votes in the House.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't need them. 1978, the FEC voted a regulatory rule that opened the\ndoor to soft\nmoney. The FEC can close it again with 4 of the 6 votes. We don't need a law.\n\nLOBELL\nAnd how are you going to get the four votes?\n\nBARTLET\nTwo seats opened up, I nominated Bacon and Calhoun.\n\nLOBELL\nThat's two.\n\nBARTLET\nBarry Haskel was with us already. We took him out of the closet.\n\nLOBELL\nHow are you going to get the 4th seat to open up?\n\nBARTLET\nToby's going to take care of that right away. Max, can I count on your\nsupport to confirm\nmy candidates?\n\nLOBELL\nAnd what do I get in exchange?\n\nBARTLET\n[beat] The thanks of a grateful President.\n\nLOBELL\nGood answer, sir.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Toby] Go.\n\nToby leaves.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Lobell] Thank you.\n\nThey shake hands.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I'm trying to pick up some sign and\nright now we're\ndoing it by letters of the alphabet. So I had Kenny come over and interpret\nit, and it\nturns out she said \"you think you only have so many times left you can come\ninto the\nOval Office and say you're wrong.\"\n\nC.J.\nHe hasn't been calling my number that much, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nHe did on this. This last three weeks, the media strategy was yours.\n\nC.J.\nI know.\n\nJOSH\nYou should listen to Joey. Holding at 42 is a good number. You shouldn't\nexpect a\nfive-point bump.\n\nC.J.\nI do expect it.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. [beat] He thinks of you like a daughter, C.J.\n\nC.J.\nThat's not a good enough reason to keep me here.\n\nJOSH\nYou'll come as soon as you get it?\n\nC.J.\nYup.\n\nJOSH\nCause we're all waiting over there.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nJosh leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nBartlet, Leo, Toby, Sam, Joey, Kenny, and Mandy are all waiting.\n\nLEO\nThey're delivering it to her?\n\nMANDY\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nAnd she's going to bring it right here.\n\nMANDY\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nLong silence as Charlie comes in. He gives Bartlet a cup of coffee.\n\nBARTLET\nKassenbach was okay?\n\nTOBY\nI'm sorry, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nKassenbach was okay?\n\nTOBY\nHe's gonna be an ambassador; he feels pretty good.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you tell him about the weather?\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nScuba diving?\n\nTOBY\n[chuckling] Yes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nFull diplomatic immunity?\n\nTOBY\nYes sir. Though, there really aren't a... a lot of laws in Micronesia, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nSure.\n\nJOSH\n[enters] Good evening.\n\nBARTLET\nGood evening, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nI just saw C.J. She'll be here with it in a minute.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\nJoey and I have been working on a counter argument to Alexis de Tocqueville.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're having a fight with Alexis de Tocqueville?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nMr. President, please don't get him started.\n\nJOSH\nJoey, what say you to the position that with ethnic warfare spreading around\nthe globe,\nand in particularly in Eastern Europe, it's only a matter of time before it\nreaches our\nshores and making English the official language of the United States will\nsafeguard\nagainst the destruction of our national identity and help us avoid ethnic\nstrife? What\nsay you to that?\n\nJoey blows a big raspberry.\n\nJOSH\nYou see that? That's what I've been dealing with all week.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nMr. President, 72% of Hispanics are strongly opposed to such a law. The\nRepublicans will\nnever put it on the table because they'll risk losing the second largest\nethnic block of\nvoters in the country. But if you need a counter argument, then I'd mention\nto Monsieur\nde Tocqueville, over here, that aside from it being bigoted and\nunconstitutional, it's\nludicrous to think that laws need to be created to help protect the language\nof Shakespeare.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, that's all I was looking for, that one line. Took you four days.\n\nJoey blows a big raspberry again.\n\nJOSH\nShe did it again.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nJoey sits back smugly. Another long silence.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat kind of briefcase did you get her, Sam?\n\nSAM\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat kind of briefcase?\n\nSAM\nCoach Beekman in British tan with brass hardware.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's nice.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAndare makes a nice model. Comes in black or brown, hand stained, fit a\nlaptop, notebooks,\nthe works.\n\nTOBY\nThis conversation is surreal.\n\nBARTLET\nTrieste in Milan makes a nice briefcase.\n\nC.J. quietly enters with an envelope in her hands and makes her way across\nthe room to\nBartlet.\n\nC.J.\nGood evening, Mr. President. The full polling book is 400 pages long and\nit's still\nbeing put together. I have the top sheet results.\n\nLEO\nWhat does it say?\n\nC.J.\nI was wrong. We went up nine points.\n\nC.J. smiles. Leo smiles and starts to laugh, but catches himself. There are\nsmiles all around.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, what's next?\n\nLEO\nWe should talk about the new projections.\n\nEveryone starts talking at once.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

THE NEWSEUM - NIGHT\n\n\tLIVE TOWN HALL MEETING\n\tTHE NEWSEUM\n\tROSSLYN, VIRGINIA\n\nIn the alley behind the Newseum, there are waiting crowds and limos.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nHere's another one. Two politicians are having an argument. One of them\nstands up and\nsays, \"You're lying!\" The other one answers, \"Yes, I am, but hear me out.\"\n\nThe audience laughs.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nA monitor shot of Bartlet on stage.\n\nMODERATOR [VO]\nMr. President, do you have time for one more question?\n\nCUT TO: INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS\n\nBARTLET\nI don't think I answered the last one. Suzanne's got me telling jokes. Here's\nan answer\nto your question that I don't think you're going to like the current crop\nof 18-25 year\nolds is the most politically apathetic generation in American history. In\n1972, half of\nthat age group voted. In the last election, 32%. Your generation is\nconsiderably less\nlikely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies,\nor work\non political campaigns. A man once said this, \"decisions are made by those\nwho show up.\"\nSo are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.\n\nGina is on a catwalk above the audience, talking to another Secret Service\nAgent.\n\nGINA\nWe're moments away. I'm going to get the door.\n\nBARTLET\n. . .there's a guy on my staff who showed me a report from the Center of\nPolicy\nAlternatives that said 61% of your age group agree with the statement\n\"Politicians\nand political officials -\n\nIn the lobby of the Newseum. Josh, C.J. and Carol stand in the room. Reporters\nmill-about.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\n- have failed my generation. When asked how older generations see you,\nyour answers were\n\"lazy\", \"confused,\" and \"unfocused\".\n\nREPORTER [OS]\nWhat's that source?\n\nJOSH\nThe Center of Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for the bus ride\nback.\n\nBARTLET [OS]\nWhen asked how you see yourselves, your answers were \"ambitious\", \"determined\",\nand\n\"independent\". [CUT TO: Bartlet onstage] Uh, I want to continue with this,\n[Bartlet\nglances offstage to Charlie, who looks very happy] but there was some debate\namongst\nmy staff earlier today as to whether or not I should take off my jacket. Some\nthought\nthat it would fit in nicely with the folksy atmosphere of a town meeting,\nothers thought\nthat it wouldn't be presidential. Can I trust you all to read nothing more\ninto it than\nI've been talking for two hours and it's a little hot under these lights?\n\nThe audience applauds as Bartlet takes off his jacket.\n\nSam stands at the end of the control room, reading some notes.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nSee all that ambition and determination doesn't translate into political\naction, Suzanne.\n\nBonnie walks up to Sam.\n\nBONNIE\nWhere's Toby?\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nBONNIE\nHe's got a phone call.\n\nSAM\nFrom who?\n\nBONNIE\nPeter Jobson.\n\nSAM\nGive it to me.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\n- that tax burden has crept further and further down the income and age\nladder. And\nbenefits are going more and more to the elderly and well-to-do. Totaling\nall payments\nto individuals...\n\nToby is watching Bartlet on a monitor in the lobby.\n\nSAM\nToby?\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nWe spend nine times as much on the elderly as we do on a single child.\n\nToby turns around. Sam shoots his arm up in the air in a wavy motion. Toby\nsighs with\nrelief and turns to look over the railing to Josh standing below.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nNo wonder this upcoming generation has turned its back on a government that's\nforgotten\nthem.\n\nTOBY\nJosh. [makes the wavy sign to Josh]\n\nJosh is at the bottom of the stairs. He gets Leo's attention.\n\nJOSH\nLeo.\n\nLeo turns around, Josh makes the wavy sign.\n\nLEO\nWhat's that?\n\nJOSH\nIt's the signal.\n\nLEO\nI thought that was the signal for the other thing?\n\nJOSH\nIt's the signal for this thing, now.\n\nLEO\nWhen did that happen?\n\nJOSH\nIt happened just... who cares, Leo? It's the signal for this thing, now.\n\nLEO\nSo, we're totally out of the woods?\n\nJOSH\nGo tell the President.\n\nC.J. is in the Newseum Press Room, walking behind the rows of reporters.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nOverall entitlement payments have crowded out public investment in\ninfrastructure and\nthey will have crowded out public investment in education., to say nothing\nof the general\nquality of life. So college kids are facing a future of having to pay higher\ntaxes...\n\nC.J. hits Danny on the back of the head on her way past him.\n\nC.J.\nFollow me.\n\nDANNY\nWhy?\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nToday's young people aren't exactly living for tomorrow.\n\nC.J.\nI have a tip.\n\nDANNY\nYou do?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nDANNY\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nI have a tip and I'm going to give it to you before the others.\n\nDANNY\nAre we being watched?\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nDANNY\nThen why are we talking like this?\n\nC.J.\nI have news.\n\nDANNY\nWhat's the news?\n\nC.J.\nI want you to acknowledge that I'm doing something nice for you.\n\nDANNY\nWhat's the news?\n\nC.J.\nA peace pipe of sorts.\n\nDANNY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nAn offering, in one sense.\n\nDANNY\nWhat's the damn news?\n\nC.J.\nCall your science editor.\n\nDANNY\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nIt's about the Space Shuttle Columbia.\n\nLeo walks behind the audience. As Bartlet speaks, Leo walks up in front of\na monitor and\nmakes \"the signal\" so Bartlet can see it.\n\nBARTLET\nGeneration x advocacy group third millennium, 53 of 18 to 25 year olds\nbelieve the soap\nopera General Hospital will outlast Medicare. This from a generation convinced\nthat the\ngeneration before them has ransomed their generation's future. That's why\nmy youngest\ndaughter Zoey is always mad at me.\n\nThe audience laughs. Zoey looks down at her father affectionately.\n\nBARTLET\nThis is the part where Zoey tries to crawl under a seat to hide. Don't worry\nabout it,\nsweetie, I'll bring out the baby pictures any second now.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - NIGHT\nCrowds cheer on the side.

[surveys the crowd]\n\nCUT TO: INT. NEWSEUM AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS\nCharlie walks up to Josh in the back of the auditorium.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nStrange as it may seem, that was the first time in history that anyone had\nbothered to\nwrite that down.\n\nCHARLIE\nDid you hear that?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe used it.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe used the material I told him about.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou were right.\n\nJOSH\nAbout what?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt doesn't go away.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nThank you, everyone.

Straight to the car. I've got Bookbag.\n\nBartlet, the staff, and Zoey walk out to the limos. Gina escorts Zoey to\none of the limos.\n\nZOEY\n[to Gina] Baby pictures, he's heckling me with it. And visa card bills\n[on her father\nwalking to the crowd] And look, now he's working the rope line. If there's\never a chance\nhe's going to walk past a crowd of people. Charlie!\n\nCharlie walks up, while Gina apprehensively looks over the crowd.\n\nGINA\n[muttering] I saw something.\n\nZOEY\nBy the way, Charlie apologized to me. He made a full apology.\n\nGINA\nI saw something!\n\nIn the crowd, a troublesome-looking young man looks up at something behind\nGina's head.\nGina turns around in slow-motion to see what he is looking at.

ROCK CREEK PARKWAY - DAY\nJosh and Hoynes are jogging towards the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nJOSH\nThere was a reckless deregulation of the S&amp;L industry by a Democratic Congress,\nit was\nflooded with S&amp;L donations.

I don't know how we've done it, but we've legalized bribery.\n\nHOYNES\nYup.\n\nJOSH\nSo, now what we've got is two corporate parties - one pro-life, one\npro-choice.\n\nHOYNES\nJosh, like I said, what's your point? I mean, what's your point?\n\nJOSH\nWe've noticed the sudden increase in racquetball and late-night poker games\nwith\ndemocratic opponents of campaign finance reform.\n\nHOYNES\nCome on, Josh, this is Washington, DC, you can't swing a dead cat without\nhitting a\ndemocratic opponent of campaign finance reform.\n\nJOSH\nCan we stop running for a second? [They stop running] You're backing the\nwrong horse.\nYou read the same polls I do. President's gone up nine points in three\nweeks. 51% job\napproval - big deal. But he's going on national television tonight, that's\ngoing to be\nanother 5 that's 56%, a 14-point bump in a month.\n\nHOYNES\nLook, Josh...\n\nJOSH\nHang on. If we bring this pilot back home alive, that's another 10 points. And\nthen\nwe're off to the races with a job approval rating in the high 60s. Now every\nDemocratic\ncongressman in a tight race is looking to get his picture taken with the\npresident,\nand you're looking around the racquetball court, saying, \"Where did everybody\ngo?\"\nYou've had some experience battling Jed Bartlet when he's right, and you've\nhad some\nexperience battling him when he's popular. Why in the world would you want\nto try it\nwhen he's both at the same time?\n\nHOYNES\nYou know something, Josh, sometimes I wonder if I'd listened to you two\nyears ago,\nwould I be President right now? Do you ever wonder that?\n\nJOSH\nNo sir, I know it for sure. [on Hoynes' nod] I'm done.

We've got some kind\nof signal?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, for if we know something during the town hall.\n\nLEO\nCould be days.\n\nJOSH\nMaybe not.\n\nLEO\nWhat is the signal?\n\nJOSH\nIt's this. [demonstrates the signal]\n\nLEO\nWhat is that?\n\nJOSH\nIt's the signal.\n\nLEO\nIt looks like a hip-hop gesture.\n\nJOSH\nIt's, uh, a plane taking off.\n\nLEO\nDoesn't look like a plane taking off.\n\nJOSH\n[repeats it again] It means something good has happened. [does the signal\ngoing down\ninstead of up] This means something bad has happened. [does the signal going\nup]\nThis means something good has happened.\n\nLEO\nI've got it.\n\nJOSH\nYou don't have to be a cryptographer.\n\nLEO\nI said I've got it.\n\nJOSH\nLeo.

I can't believe you chickened out.\n\nCHARLIE\nI didn't chicken out. And I didn't need prompting. It just wasn't appropriate.\n\nHe leads her into JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nCHARLIE\nI don't have the same relationship with your father that you have, I don't\nhave the same\nrelationship that the staff has.\n\nZOEY\nI don't think it's out of line for you to put your two cents in.\n\nJosh walks in.\n\nJOSH\nHi.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm sorry, we were just using your office for a minute.\n\nJOSH\nYou can keep fighting in just a second, I just need to find something.\n\nZOEY\nI also don't think it was out of line for me to stick up for you, since you\nwere clearly\nchicken.\n\nCHARLIE\nZoey, I work in a building with the smartest people in the world...\n\nJosh goes to sit down on his non-existent chair and Zoey and Charlie watch\nhim fall to\nthe floor.

Cathy's getting Peter Jobson on the phone for you, he's\ngoing to tell\nyou about this.\n\nTOBY\nSam.\n\nSAM\nThere was a screw-up when they closed the door. They were doing something,\nwhich is\ncalled a manual winch op, which means they disconnect the motor from the door,\nand\nsomehow either as a result of that, or of something completely unrelated,\nthe two OMS\nengines are failing. OMS are the orbital maneuvering systems.\n\nTOBY\nDo you know if they have primary RCS?\n\nSAM\nThat's what they're trying now.\n\nToby nods tersely.\n\nSAM\nToby. If this were at a certain level, they would call the President.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nSeriously.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nAnyway, Cathy's getting Peter Jobson.\n\nTOBY\nBefore, when you first asked me, the reason I reacted the way I didI was\njust embarrassed.\nCause honestly, I forgot he was up there. They had switched his mission\norder around a\ncouple of times and I just lost track of it.\n\nCathy enters.\n\nCathy\nToby, Peter Jobson's on line 5.\n\nToby picks up the phone.\n\nTOBY\n[to Sam and Cathy] Thank you.\n\nSam and Cathy leave.

And so, I was reading it, and so I was reading it,\nand during\nprep this week, you've been having discussions with the senior staff about\nyouth\nparticipation in the political process. You were saying...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's the report?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's from a group called the Center for Policy Alternatives. And there's\nsome things\nthat hit home with me, and I mentioned it to Zoeyy, and that's why...\n\nMrs. Landingham enters, interrupting.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nMRS.

In one talon he's holding arrows,\nand in the other\nan olive branch. Most of the time, the eagle's facing the olive branch,\nbut when Congress\ndeclares war, the eagle faces the talons. How do they do that? You think\nthey've got a\nsecond carpet sitting around in the basement someplace?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't know.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nMaybe this piece in the middle cuts out and they do it like a basketball\ncourt.\n\nBARTLET\nI honestly don't know, Fitz.\n\nMrs. Landingham comes in.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nExcuse me, Chairman, that's your call, the blinking light.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThank you. I'll stop bugging you in just a minute Mr. President. [into phone]\nYeah?\nThanks.

[goes to leave]\n\nBARTLET\nSeriously, I'm going to get an answer for you on that.\n\nFitzwallace leaves, Bartlet picks up the phone.\n\nBARTLET\nCaptain Hutchins, this is President Bartlet. How's your ankle? Good. Now\nbefore you say\nanother word, give me your parents' phone number. I never get to make\nthis call.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Most of us have to pile into buses\nto get over to\nArlington. All this material will be covered in much greater detail at the\nPentagon\nbriefing, which will take place 30 minutes after our return. That's all for\nnow.\n\nC.J. exits as the reporters call her name. Danny gets up to go after her.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\nCAROL\nNice!\n\nC.J.\nI have to congratulate you, Carol. I was afraid I was going to see Saudi\nArabia spelled\nwith a 'y'.\n\nCAROL\nC.J., I'm a much better speller than you give me credit for.\n\nC.J.\nYes.

I did exactly the right thing. Your\nnose is bent out\nof joint, and I don't give a damn.\n\nDANNY\nYou looked at me point-blank and told me you were looking at a diplomatic...\n\nC.J.\nDanny...\n\nDANNY\nYou looked at me and told me...\n\nC.J.\nWhat did you think I was going to do, Danny? Give you longitude and\nlatitude? Did you\nthink I was going to fork over the radio frequency that we're transmitting on?\n\nDANNY\nYou didn't have to answer the question.\n\nC.J.\nI did!\n\nDANNY\nYou could have said, \"Danny, we're not ruling anything in or out, and I'm\nnot going to\nlet you take me down that path\" and we would have been done with it.\n\nC.J.\nDanny, if by standing up and lying, I misdirected Iraqi intelligence for\neven half a\nbeat, then it was absolutely worth it. That's a no-brainer. And if I didn't,\nit was\ncertainly worth trying. There were only 50 people in the world who can't\nunderstand why\nI lied this morning, and they all work in the White House pressroom. I'm\nsleeping fine\ntonight.\n\nDANNY\nYou didn't have to call on me. Every hand shot up, everybody's hand shot up,\neverybody\nwas going to ask the same question, you knew what your answer was going to\nbe, and you\ncalled on me.\n\nC.J.\nWell, yes, I did.\n\nDANNY\nAnd you wouldn't have rather done that to a journalist that's been less\nsupportive of\nthis administration than I have?\n\nC.J.\nNo, I chose you.\n\nDANNY\nC.J., I'm not staying in the penalty box forever. I've covered the White\nHouse for eight\nyears, and I've done it for the New York Times, the Washington Post, Time\nMagazine, and\nthe Dallas Morning News! And I'm telling you, you can't mess me around like\nthis.\n\nC.J.\nDanny, I got to tell you, that was, seriously, that was a turn-on when you\nsaid that,\nthough I don't know why you decided to be the most haughty on the Dallas\nMorning News.\n\nDANNY\nC.J..\n\nCarol enters.\n\nCAROL\nThe buses are leaving.\n\nC.J.\n[to Danny, who's still fuming] The buses are leaving.\n\nC.J. exits.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nBartlet enters. Toby's looking out the window.\n\nBARTLET\nToby?\n\nNo reaction.\n\nBARTLET\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nExcuse me, Mr. President. I'm sorry.\n\nBARTLET\nYou can't see them, they're over Australia now. I just spoke with the mission\ncommander.\nThey're trying firing something called an RCS?\n\nTOBY\nYeah, it's the reaction control system. It's actually 40 separate engines\naround the\nshuttle.\n\nBARTLET\nIf that doesn't work, they've got about 39 other things they can try. There's\nredundancy\nafter redundancy after redundancy built in. And for good measure, they have\nAtlantis\nwarming up on the launch pad. It can dock with the Columbia in about two\nhours. We can\ndo that now, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nFirst thing the shuttle does after it leaves the atmosphere is open the\ncargo bay doors.\nThat's what lets the heat out. Once those doors close, they have a pretty\nshort window to\nget back before it overheats.\n\nBARTLET\nThen they'll open those doors again.\n\nTOBY\nHow?\n\nBARTLET\nSame way they closed them - with a five-dollar wrench.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen we're done tonight, you should take the next flight out to Edwards'\nAir Force Base,\nmeet the thing when it lands, stop being a horse's ass, and talk to your\nbrother.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President. I appreciate you trying to be a comfort, and I appreciate\nthat you have\nsome understanding of the situation with my brother. But the thing was\nsupposed to land\n19 hours ago. Obviously, there's a problem. It's space travel, and I don't\nbelieve any\nproblem is minor.\n\nBARTLET\nShuttle flies itself, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nNo, it doesn't, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, it doesn't.\n\nBartlet exits. Toby slowly puts on his jacket and follows him out.\n\nFADE TO: INT. THE NEWSEUM - NIGHT\nBartlet is already on the STAGE.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you, thank you very much. That was a joke about politicians. [audience\nlaughter]\nTwo politicians are having an argument. The first one yells, 'but you're\nlying!' and the\nother one answers, 'yes, I know, but hear me out!\"\n\nGina walks on the CATWALK.\n\nGINA\n[to the other agent] We're moments away. I'm going to get the door.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't think I answered the last one. Suzanne's got me telling jokes. Here's\nan answer\nto your question that I don't think you're going to like. A man once said\nthis,\n\"decisions are made by those who show up.\" So are we failing you, or are\nyou failing us?\n[hand shake] A little of both. There's a guy on my staff named Charlie Young,\nhe showed\nme a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of\nyou agree with\nthe statement \"The older generation has failed my generation\". When asked\nhow the older\ngeneration sees you, your top answers are \"lazy\", \"confused,\" and\n\"unfocused\".\n\nJosh watches in the LOBBY.\n\nReporter\nWhat was that source again?\n\nJOSH\nCenter for Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for you on the bus\nride back.\n\nBARTLET\nIf I take my jacket off, can I trust you all to read nothing more into it\nthan I've been\ntalking for two hours and it's a little hot under these lights?\n\nThe audience applauds, and Bartlet takes off his jacket.\n\nIn the PRESS AREA, C.J. walks behind the reporters. She hits Danny in the\nback of\nthe head.\n\nC.J.\nFollow me.\n\nDANNY\nWhy? [follows her]\n\nBonnie approaches Sam in the CONTROL ROOM.\n\nBONNIE\nWhere's Toby?\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nBONNIE\nHe's got a phone call.\n\nSAM\nFrom who?\n\nBONNIE\nPeter Jobson.\n\nSAM\nGive it to me.\n\nToby in the HALLWAY watches the President talk.\n\nSAM\nToby?\n\nSam makes \"the signal\" when Toby turns around. Toby nods in relief. Toby\nmakes the\nsignal down in the lobby to Josh, and then turns around and sighs in relief.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS\nGina walks out to Ron.\n\nRON\nGina! Straight to the car.\n\nGINA\nHe's not going to work the rope line?\n\nRON\nThere's a softball game the President wants to watch.\n\nGINA\nThey show softball on TV?\n\nRON\nWell, yeah.\n\nGINA\nAnd the president watches it?\n\nGina and Ron walk past a menacing looking young man wearing a cap, gray\nshirt,\nand the biggest \"Bartlet\" button in the world.

NEWSEUM - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet is still on the stage.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're telling me that we're out of time. I just want to mention that at\nseveral points\nduring the evening, I was referred to as both a liberal and a populist,\nand a fellow\nfourth from the back called me a socialist, which is nice, I haven't heard\nthat for a\nwhile.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

We hold these truths to be self-evident,\nthey said,\nthat all men are created equal. Strange as it may seem, that was the first\ntime in\nhistory that anyone had bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by\nthose who\nshow up. Class dismissed. Thank you, everyone. God bless you. And God bless\nAmerica.\n\nThe audience applauds.\n\nJOSH\nWay to go.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

Now thirteen hours ago they shot down an F-117 in\nthe No-Fly.\nThe rescue mission invaded their airspace with armed M-50 Pave Hawks. And my\nrecommendation would be that the President order Fitzwallace to put the 32nd\ntactical on ready alert and take us to Defcon 4.\n\nLEO\nThe President is under general anesthesia right now.

If fidelity to freedom\nand\ndemocracy is the code of our civic religion then surely, the code of our\nhumanity is\nfaithful service to that unwritten commandment that says \"We shall give our\nchildren\nbetter than we ourselves had.\" I voted against the bill 'cause I didn't want\nit to be\nhard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your\npocket.

Jerry, Cal, Mack, Steve -- you're fired.\n\nCAL\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nLEO\nNo kidding. It's moving day. I want Toby. The rest of you-- thanks very much.\n\nThey all stare at Leo.\n\nLEO\nFellas. Look at my face. You're done.\n\nEveryone except Leo and Toby leaves.\n\nLEO\n[to Toby] Don't screw up.\n\nLeo exits. Toby is sitting alone under the light.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

It's time we bring in what we need.\n\nBARTLET\nSo you made that decision on your own.\n\nLEO\nYeah. You know why? 'Cause you're a crappy politician. I think you'll find\nI'll be making\na lot of decisions on my own so get used to it.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know I got elected to Congress by this state. This state sent me to\nCongress three\ntimes and elected me Governor all without your help.\n\nLEO starts grinning.\n\nBARTLET\nDon't start!\n\nLEO\nNo, seriously, that's a real political accomplishment, considering that your\nfamily\nfounded this state.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nLEO\nWere you even opposed in any of those elections?\n\nBARTLET\nYou got rid of all the people I know!\n\nLEO\nYeah. Have a good night.\n\nLeo walks off. Bartlet follows.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy are you doing this? You're a player. You're bigger in the party than I\nam. Hoynes\nwould make you national chairman. Leo! Tell me this isn't one of the twelve\nsteps.\n\nLeo turns around to face his friend.\n\nLEO\nYeah, that's what it is. Right after admitting we're powerless over alcohol\nand that a\nhigher power can restore us to sanity, that's where you come in.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo.\n\nLEO\nBecause I'm tired of it year after year after year after year having to\nchose between the\nlesser of who cares? Of trying to get myself excited about a candidate who\ncan speak in\ncomplete sentences. Of setting the bar so low, I can hardly look at it. They\nsay a good\nman can't get elected President. I don't believe that, do you?\n\nBARTLET\nAnd you think I'm that man.\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nDoes it matter that I'm not as sure?\n\nLEO\nNah. Act as if ye have faith and faith shall be given to you. Put it another\nway, fake it\ntill you make it. You did good tonight.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nThey start walking again.\n\nLEO\nThis is the time of Jed Bartlet, old friend. You're gonna open your mouth\nand lift houses\noff the ground.

The camera pans into room\nitself, where\nToby, Donna, Abbey, Charlie and Sam sit with a few secret service agents,\nincluding\nGina, who's pacing.\n\nC.J.

GAGE WHITNEY CONFERENCE ROOM - THREE YEARS EARLIER\n\n\tGAGE WHITNEY PACE\n\tMIDTOWN MANHATTAN\n\tTHREE YEARS EARLIER\n\nThe camera pans down a long conference table, resting finally on an over\nthe shoulder\nshot of Sam.\n\nFEMALE LAWYER [VO]\nThe ships will be registered in Libya and Panama, so they won't be subject\nto the OPA,\nwhich wouldn't allow an American company to keep a tanker like this in\nservice very long.\n\nASSOCIATE\nI think 2017.\n\nFEMALE LAWYER\nI think 2015, and we'll check that, but you get the idea.\n\nMR. GAGE\nI think all that's left, then is to dot the tees.\n\nSAM\nActually. I have a thing. I have a thing I was going to mention, just a\nproposal to throw\nout there. When I was a congressional aide, we had an expression, 'no idea\nwas too stupid\nto say out loud,' so here it is, bear me out. [beat] Instead of buying these\nships? Don't\nbuy these ships. Buy other ships. Better ships. That's my idea.\n\nMR. LOCH\n[to Mr. Gage] What is he talking about?\n\nMR. GAGE\nThat's a perfectly fair question. Sam, what the hell are you talking about?\n\nSAM\nAnd the good news is we have a no-penalty clause we can exercise if we pull\nout before\nthe First of December.\n\nMR. CAMERON\nBut Sam, we want these ships. This is as little as we've ever paid for a\nfleet.\n\nSAM\nWell, there's a reason why they don't cost a lot of money. They're 20-year\nold single\nhulled VLCCs that nobody wants. When they hit things, they will break. And\nthey will\nhit things, because they don't have state of the art navigation systems. They\ndon't\nhave G3 tank gauging, or EM-5000 engine monitoring, the recommended\nstaletronic, or\nelectopneumotronic ballast.\n\nMR. GAGE\n[chuckling] And yesterday, he didn't know the difference between a ship and\na boat!\n\nMR. LOCH\nSam, I thought you told us that you covered our liability.\n\nSAM\nI did. Strictly speaking, I did. But there's a broader liability to think\nabout. People\ndrove past Exxon Stations after the Valdez.\n\nMR. CAMERON\nWe've got PR firms for PR problems.\n\nSAM\nThere's a Suez tanker ready to launch in the Koje Island shipyard in\nKorea. Chevron just\ndropped the option, and it's sitting there in its cradle. Let's go get it.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam, can I talk you for a second?\n\nSam follows Mr. Gage out, while still talking to the client.\n\nSAM\n308,000 deadweight tons, carries 2.2 million gallons, and you can have it\ntoday for 46\nmillion.\n\nMR. LOCH\n46 million dollars?\n\nSAM\nThat's a good price!\n\nThey walk out to the HALLWAY.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam, what are you doing?\n\nSAM\nI think I have an obligation.\n\nMR. GAGE\nWhat are you doing?\n\nSAM\nMaybe they want to buy safer boats, but we never gave them the option.\n\nMR. GAGE\nAre you trying to get fired?\n\nSAM\nMaybe they're really going to thank us for this suggestion.\n\nMR. GAGE\nKnock it off, Sam!\n\nSAM\nLook...\n\nMR. GAGE\nKnock it off!\n\nHe storms back inside the conference room.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. MANHATTAN PAY PHONE - DAY\nJosh is outside in the rain, back on the pay phone.\n\nJOSH\n[into phone] Look, Operator, I'm looking for the number of a law firm in\nManhattan.\nHere's the thing, I can't quite remember the name of the firm... no, wait,\nwait, wait!\nI just came back from New Hampshire, where I saw this guy and now I have\nto... look it's\na very famous firm that handles Shearson, you must know... okay, you know\nwhat, I'm just\ngoing to - okay, bye.\n\nHe hangs up the phone, runs to the curb -- Remembers! -- then turns back\nand runs the\nother way.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nThe conference room again.\n\nMR. CAMERON\nThat's amortized over--?\n\nFEMALE LAWYER\n15 years.\n\nMR. CAMERON\nPre-tax?\n\nFEMALE LAWYER\nSam?\n\nSAM\nHmm?\n\nFEMALE LAWYER\n15 million pre-tax amortization.\n\nSAM\n[to clients, giving it one last shot] 11 million extra dollars.\n\nThe female lawyer groans.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam!\n\nMR. LOCH\nWe're back to this.\n\nSAM\nMoney's going to be spent, Mr. Loch, you can spend it now, or you can spend\nit later,\nbut it's cheaper to spend it now.\n\nMR. LOCH\nSam.\n\nSAM\nAnd it's also the right thing to do. Spend 11 million extra dollars.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam!\n\nSAM\nSpend it on a better boat.\n\nMR. GAGE\nDamn it!\n\nSAM\nThe Amoco Cadiz, 68 million gallons of crude oil off of Brittany, France. The\nBraer,\na Liberian Tanker 26 million gallons off the Shetland Islands. I just pulled\nthese off\nthe internet last night! The Exxon Valdez. The Aegaen Sea. The Argo\nMerchant. Look it up!\n\nMR. GAGE\nI'm sure they're...\n\nSAM\nSpend an extra 11 million dollars!\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam, that's enough!\n\nSAM\nYou don't want to pay for it? Pass the expense on to us.\n\nFEMALE LAWYER\nSam!\n\nPast her, we can see a very wet Josh walking up the conference room doors.\n\nSAM\nHalf a penny at the tank. Here's five bucks. A thousand people are on me.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam!\n\nJosh knocks on the window, causing Sam to look over to him. Josh is pretty\nmuch just\nstanding there, looking really wet and vaguely... prophetic.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam.\n\nSam can't take his eyes off of Josh.\n\nFEMALE LAWYER\nSam, we're in the middle of a meeting.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nMR. LOCH\nSam, we're not indifferent to the concerns of the environmentalists... Excuse\nme, Sam?\n\nJosh points to his non-poker-playing face.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nMR. LOCH\nIt doesn't quite feel like I have your attention.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJosh is still pointing to his face, smiles and nods slowly, Sam laughs.\n\nSAM\nYeah! Yeah.\n\nHe shuffles his papers, then pulling away from them.\n\nSAM\nI'm not going to need that.\n\nMR. GAGE\nSam? Sam! Sam, please keep your seat!

She surfaces, sputtering.\n\nTOBY\nC.J., you fell into the pool, there.\n\nC.J.\nI can't see!\n\nTOBY\nYeah, well, maybe, kind of, uh, try to feel your way to dry land?\n\nC.J.\nShut up!\n\nToby puts his hands on his hips.

C.J. straggles out the pool, tries to cover herself with\nher wet\nclothes, but it's really no use.\n\nC.J.\nOh, turn around.\n\nHe does, and C.J. walks up the stairs past him, and reaches into the house\nfor a towel.\n\nTOBY\nI tried calling you at your office. They said you were fired. Were you\nstealing things?\n\nC.J.\nRoger Becker dropped from third most powerful person in Hollywood to ninth\nmost powerful\nperson in Hollywood.\n\nTOBY\nDoes he still make the playoffs, or is the cutoff line...\n\nC.J.\nThey take it seriously.\n\nTOBY\nC.J., Jed Bartlet is very impressed with you.\n\nC.J. looks up at him, startled.\n\nTOBY\nHe likes the work that you did with that girl's group with the stupid name.\n\nC.J.\nEmily's List?\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nThat girl's group with the stupid name?\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nEmily's List -- \"early money is like yeast\".\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\n\"It helps raise the dough\".\n\nTOBY\nI get it.\n\nC.J.\nThey raise money for women candidates. 'Early money is like yeast, it helps\nraise the\ndough.' For the candidates.\n\nTOBY\nI really do get it.\n\nC.J.\nBartlet's impressed with me?\n\nTOBY\nVery impressed. And one of the big keys to his game plan is bringing you on\nas Press\nSecretary.\n\nC.J.\nHe's never heard of me, has he?\n\nTOBY\nNo.\n\nC.J.\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nI'm here on instructions from Leo McGarry.\n\nC.J.\nMcGarry wants me.\n\nTOBY\nYes. Come join the campaign.\n\nC.J.\nHow much does it pay?\n\nTOBY\nHow much were you making before?\n\nC.J.\n$550,000 a year.\n\nTOBY\nThis pays $600 a week.\n\nC.J.\nSo this would be less.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nToby. Does he know I've only ever worked statewide? Does he know I've never\nworked on a\nnational campaign before?\n\nTOBY\nYes. It's Graduation Day.\n\nC.J.\nYou really think I can do this?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nIs Jed Bartlet a good man?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nThen, let's go into the house so I can change my clothes and we can talk\nabout it.\n\nC.J. starts walking, still wringing out her hair.\n\nTOBY\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYeah?\n\nTOBY\nHouse is over there.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nC.J. turns around, and Toby watches her go.\n\nCUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRESENT\nIn Bartlet's hospital room, Ron Butterfield briefs Bartlet, Abbey and Zoey.\n\nRON\nOne of them was using 9 millimeter Baretta, the other had a 357 Desert Eagle.\n\nABBEY\nRon's saying that these were the absolutely wrong weapons to use for a\nshooting of this\nkind. And that's why the injury count was as low as it was.\n\nBARTLET\nWe don't know what the injury count is, yet.\n\nABBEY\nYeah, but his point is --\n\nThe door opens. It's Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nExcuse me, sir, I was told you wanted to see me?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Charlie, the guy the Secret Service has in custody is named Carl\nLeroy. He gives\na statement in which he says that he and the two shooters were members of\nan organization\ncalled West Virginia White Pride.\n\nCHARLIE\nThey tried to kill the President 'cause Zoey and I are together?\n\nABBEY\nNo.\n\nCHARLIE\nThen why did --?\n\nRON\nCharlie. The President wasn't the target. According to the statement, the\nPresident\nwasn't the target.\n\nCharlie tries hard to accept the fact.\n\nCHARLIE\nOh. Okay. Okay, well. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nHe exits.\n\nZOEY\nDad, I'm going to --\n\nBARTLET\nGo.\n\nRon exits behind Zoey, closing the door.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Abbey] We don't know what the injury count is, yet.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: EXT. OVERVIEW OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY\n\n\tTUESDAY, 6:15AM\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\nMargaret and Leo are inside. Leo is sitting in a chair looking over papers,\nwhile\nMargaret stands over him.\n\nMARGARET\nHe was supposed to sign a letter?\n\nLEO\nThe President is going under general anesthesia, he usually signs a letter\nhanding over\nexecutive powers to the Vice President.\n\nMARGARET\nAnd the President didn't sign the letter.\n\nLEO\nNope. We blew that play.\n\nMARGARET\nIs there going to be trouble?\n\nLEO\nWe'll see. To be honest with you, I don't really care right now.\n\nMARGARET\nCan I -- can I just say something for the future?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nMARGARET\nI can sign the President's name. I have his signature down pretty good.\n\nLeo looks up at her for the first time.\n\nLEO\nYou can sign the President's name?\n\nMARGARET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nOn a document removing him from power and handing it to someone else.\n\nMARGARET\nYeah! [on Leo's look of disbelief] Or... do you think the White House Counsel\nwould say\nthat was a bad idea.\n\nLEO\nI think the White House Counsel would say it was a coup d'etat!\n\nMARGARET\nWell. I'd probably end up doing some time for that.\n\nLEO\nI would think.\n\nMargaret tries to beat a hasty retreat, as C.J. enters.\n\nLEO\nAnd what the hell were you doing practicing the President's signature?\n\nMARGARET\nIt was just for fun.\n\nLEO\nWe've got separation of powers, checks and balances, and Margaret vetoing\nthings and\nsending them back to the Hill.\n\nC.J.\nLeo, who thought it was a good idea for me to do the morning shows?\n\nLEO\nI did.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nThe President's not ready for cameras. If it's the Vice President, we're\ngoing to look\nlike we don't have a President, and I'd like the White House to start climbing\nout from\nbehind the bushes.\n\nC.J.\nI think it's a bad idea.\n\nLEO\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nI just... First of all, I think it's inappropriate while Josh, you know,\nuntil --\n\nLEO\nWhat's wrong?\n\nC.J.\nNothing.\n\nLEO\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nNothing. I'd rather not do it, but obviously.\n\nLEO\nHave Sam do it.\n\nC.J.\n[relieved] Okay. Listen, the letter.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nThe three and a half hours? I don't know how much longer I can dance around\nDanny, and\nit's going to be Danny times a hundred by lunchtime.\n\nToby enters.\n\nLEO\nHave him come see me.\n\nC.J.\nYeah?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nLeo and Toby walk-and-talk down the corridors.\n\nLEO\nShe doesn't want to do the morning shows.\n\nTOBY\nShe says she's been getting a couple of questions about why the President\nexited in\nthe open air. You remember the Secret Service usually constructs a tent or\na canopy.\nI'm going to talk to Ron Butterfield.\n\nLEO\nHe's going to say the Secret Service doesn't comment on procedure.\n\nTOBY\nI know. But maybe I can talk him out of it. I should try, anyway.\n\nLEO\nYou don't have to, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, I should, though.\n\nToby watches Leo exit through the front door.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BARTLET'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - THREE YEARS EARLIER\nIt's a very busy day at the headquarters. As the camera pans over volunteers,\nwe see\nToby drinking coffee. It stops on Bartlet himself, leaning on a table on\nwhich a taped\nnews program is also running.\n\n\tBARTLET CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS\n\tMANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nREPORTER [VO]\n...won the non-binding straw poll, pulling in 48% of the vote, Senator\nWilliam Willey\nof Washington State drew a poorer than expected 22% of the vote, but the\nstory this\nmorning is the 19% of the vote picked up by former New Hampshire Governor\nJed Bartlet,\nwho leapfrogged several democratic candidates to finish a surprising third. And\nwe're\ngoing to go now to Governor Bartlet, who's standing by live... okay, I'm\ntold we don't\nhave the Governor at this moment, so we while we try --\n\nC.J. clicks off the tape. Behind her, all facing Bartlet, are several campaign\nstaffers,\nincluding Sam, Toby, Leo and Josh.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, who can tell me what we did wrong there?\n\nBARTLET\nI blew it. What's next?\n\nC.J.\nWe didn't have the candidate. That's right. Anyone who answered \"we didn't\nhave the\ncandidate\" -\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's... next?\n\nJOSH\nToby wants to say something.\n\nBARTLET\nWhich one is Toby?\n\nTOBY\nI am.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Josh] And which one are you?\n\nJOSH\nI'm Josh.\n\nLEO\n[to Toby] What was it you wanted to say?\n\nTOBY\nLet's get out of New Hampshire.\n\nLEO\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\nNothing to win here.\n\nSAM\nHe's right.\n\nBARTLET\nThe New Hampshire primary isn't held in New Hampshire anymore?\n\nTOBY\nYou can't win the New Hampshire primary.\n\nBARTLET\nI am going to win the New Hampshire primary.\n\nTOBY\nWhich is why you can't win it.\n\nJOSH\nYou're incredibly popular in this state.\n\nSAM\nYou're a democrat who was elected with 69 percent of the vote. That's unheard\nof.\n\nTOBY\nThere's no way that you can exceed expectations, all you can hope for is an\n\"as expected\", and there's always the possibility that you could embarrass\nyourself.\n\nBARTLET\nI appreciate that, thanks.\n\nJOSH\nToby meant in the polls.\n\nBARTLET\nI know what he meant.\n\nTOBY\nSo, Hoynes will be in a fight with Wiley for a strong second place finish in\nNew Hampshire, meantime we're going to be in South Carolina, and we're going\nto be the only ones there.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're not going to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.\n\nTOBY\nWe don't have to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.\n\nC.J.\nWe just have to beat Wiley.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Leo] Wiley's going to drop out after South Carolina?\n\nLEO\nIf he doesn't finish higher than third.\n\nBARTLET\nAre we going to get his endorsement?\n\nLEO\nWe're going to get his money, that's for sure.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's for sure?\n\nLEO\nJosh thinks it is.\n\nBARTLET\nWhich one is Josh?\n\nJOSH\n[as Leo points at him] I am.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nTOBY\nSo, we finish second in South Carolina, we pick up some steam, some\nendorsements,\nmostly some money, going into South Dakota, Vermont, Maine --\n\nSAM\nWhere we come away with a split, maybe better, and now the prohibitive\nnominee for the\ndemocratic candidate has lost 3 out of seven contests...\n\nC.J.\nAnd half the actual primaries -\n\nSAM\nLeading into Super Tuesday.\n\nJOSH\nHoynes will take the South. We'll take the North and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nTOBY\nThis race will be decided a week later in Illinois.\n\nC.J.\nIllinois will be High Noon.\n\nLEO\nSam, if we win in Illinois, will we have a shot at California and New York?\n\nSAM\nIf we win in Illinois, we're going to run the table.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, that's it, then. And we saved people the trouble of voting. What's next?\n\nJOSH\nOur point is that it's --\n\nBARTLET\nI understand the point. We're going to South Carolina to set up Illinois. When\nI ask,\n\"What's next?\", it means that I'm ready to move on to other things. So,\nwhat's next?\n\nLEO\nWe're done.\n\nBARTLET\nFantastic.\n\nBartlet gets up and walks away. Josh walks over to Leo.\n\nJOSH\nWell, I feel bathed in the warm embrace of the candidate.\n\nLEO\nHe's very easy to like, once you get to know him.\n\nJOSH\nHow many people get that far?\n\nLEO\nNot that many.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

[to Sam] The real reason I couldn't go on the morning\nshows and give\na first-hand account of what happened is that I couldn't remember what\nhappened.\nI remember walking out of the building, I remember somebody knocked me down,\nI know my\nnecklace came off, and I know a police car window exploded over my head. All\nnight long,\nI've been doing my press briefings using notes from other people's\naccounts.

Ron, a few weeks after the President was sworn in, you got a memo\nabout his\nprotection.\n\nRON\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nIt said he wanted to enter and exit in the open air, and he didn't like the\nfeeling of\ntraveling around in an armored tank.\n\nRON\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nSpecifically, it said he wouldn't use the tent or the canopy anymore.\n\nRON\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nI wrote that memo, and the President signed it at my urging.\n\nRON\nI know.\n\nTOBY\nRon, I don't think it's right that the Secret Service get blamed for what\nhappened last\nnight, I want the Treasury Department to hand over my memo to the Press.\n\nRON\nNo, we can't do that.\n\nTOBY\nThere are going to be a lot of questions.\n\nRON\nThere are always a lot of questions.\n\nTOBY\nRon.\n\nRON\nDon't worry about it, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nIt's not right.

We got Zoey in the car. And at 150 yards,\nfive stories\nup, the shooters were down 9.2 seconds after the first shot was fired. I\nwould never let\nyou not let me protect the President. You tell us you don't like something,\nwe figure out\nsomething else. It was an act of madmen. Anyway, the Secret Service doesn't\ncomment on\nprocedure.\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nRon walks away.\n\nTOBY\nGood job last night.\n\nRON\nThank you.\n\nToby sits down on a bench and sighs heavily.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Obviously, there's one story\nthat going\ndominating news around the world for the next few days, and it would be easy\nto think\nthat President Bartlet, Joshua Lyman, and Stephanie Abbott were the only\nvictims of a gun\ncrime last night. They weren't. Mark Davis and Sheila Evans of Philadelphia\nwere killed\nby a gun last night. He was a Biology Teacher and she was a Nursing\nstudent. Tina Bishop\nand Linda Larkin were killed with a gun last night. They were 12. There were\n36 homicides\nlast night. 480 sexual assaults, 3,411 robberies, 3,685 aggravated assaults,\nall at\ngunpoint. And if anyone thinks those crimes could have been prevented if\nthe victims\nthemselves had been carrying guns, I'd only remind you that the President\nof the United\nStates himself was shot last night while surrounded by the best trained\narmed guards in\nthe history of the world. Back to the briefing.\n\nC.J. continues the briefing.\n\nDANNY\nShe's good.\n\nLEO\nYes, she is.\n\nDANNY\nLeo...\n\nLEO\nI'm going to the hospital.

CHICAGO AIRPORT - NIGHT\nIn a T.V. screen at the airplane gate, we see a reporter.\n\nREPORTER\n...very happy Bartlet Supporters. We are told the candidate is in the suite,\nrefining\nhis remarks, he's due to be down here at any moment. Just over an hour ago...\n\nThe camera pulls down to the coolest blocking on television. Two men walk\nunder the TV,\none right past an oblivious Josh. The first man says something into his\nsleeve, and stops\nto stand about three feet away from Josh, near the counter. The second man,\nearpiece\nvisible, walks past Josh on the other side of his seat, and stops to stand\nnear the\nwindows. Josh doesn't quite realize what's going on until a third man slides\ninto view\nin the front left of the screen. All of a sudden, Bartlet appears, walking\nout of the\nright side of screen, directly behind Josh.\n\n[Do yourself a favor -- if you've got it on tape, watch it a couple of more\ntimes.\nIt's the coolest thing ever.]\n\nBARTLET\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\n[jumping up] Governor!\n\nBARTLET\nYour father died, Josh. I can't believe it.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, uh, Governor, you -- you shouldn't be here.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat happened?\n\nBartlet sits down. Josh also awkwardly sits.\n\nJOSH\nHe, uh, went for his chemotherapy and he unexpectedly developed a pulmonary\nembolism,\nit's a --\n\nBARTLET\nIt's a blood clot.\n\nJOSH\nYeah. It went to his heart and there was cardiac arrest.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah... Yeah.\n\nJOSH\nGovernor, you should really get back to the ballroom, so that you can get\non a plane and\nget to California.\n\nBARTLET\nHe was a lawyer?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, a litigator.\n\nBARTLET\nDid he like that you were in politics?\n\nJOSH\nI think he would have liked grandchildren more.\n\nBARTLET\n[chuckling] He would've.\n\nJOSH\nHe liked that I was working for you. He liked that we were starting to do\nwell.\nHe would've liked tonight. At least his friends and neighbors will be spared\nall the...\nyou know...\n\nBARTLET\nHe'd have been doing some bragging?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, and your name wouldn't have come up, by the way. \"My son won the\nIllinois primary\ntonight\". Three more hours, and he would have been able to say that. He'd\nhave been proud.\n\nBARTLET\nHe was already. Trust me, Josh, I'm a father. He was already.\n\nJOSH\nI appreciate that, Governor. You should really get back to the hotel.\n\nBARTLET\nNah, I'm okay.\n\nJOSH\nSir, not that I don't appreciate you coming down here, but there's a ballroom\nfull of\npeople waiting for a victory speech.\n\nBARTLET\nThey'll wait.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, they will, but the people watching television won't.\n\nBARTLET\nI've been a real jackass to you, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nWell.\n\nBARTLET\nTo everybody. Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nDon't think I don't know what you gave up to work on this campaign, and\ndon't think that\nI don't know your value. And I'll never make you think I don't again. You\ngot to be a\nlittle impressed that I got all those names right just now.\n\nJosh chuckles.\n\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT [VO]\nDelta Airlines Flight 175 to Kennedy International now boarding...\n\nJOSH\nThey're calling my flight.\n\nHe gets up, and so does Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\nYou want me to go with you?\n\nJOSH\n[stops] Go with me?\n\nBARTLET\nMaybe you want some company on the plane.\n\nHe starts to feel all his pockets for his wallet.\n\nBARTLET\nI could get a ticket and come with you.\n\nJOSH\nGovernor! California. You have to go the ballroom and give a Victory speech\nin primetime\nand go to California.\n\nBARTLET\nI guess you're right.\n\nJOSH\n[laughing] You guess I'm right? Listen to me, Governor, if you don't lose\nthis election,\nit isn't going to be because you didn't try hard enough. But it was nice of\nyou to ask.\nThank you, I appreciate.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're calling your flight.\n\nJosh turns to board the plane, taking one last look at Bartlet, who nods\nencouragingly to\nhim. Josh boards the plane. Leo walks up behind Bartlet.\n\nLEO\nIs he going to be all right?\n\nBARTLET\nHe's going to be fine.\n\nLEO\nGood.\n\nBartlet turns around to face Leo.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nYeah?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm ready.\n\nLeo grins in understanding, and then joins Bartlet as they walk out of the\nterminal,\nseveral people recognizing Bartlet and stopping to shake his hand, all the\nwhile we hear\nBartlet giving his speech.\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nTonight, what began on the commons in Concord, Massachusetts, as an alliance\nof farmers\nand workers, of cobbles man and tinsmiths, of statesmen and students, of\nmothers and\nwives, of men and boys, lives two centuries later as America!

Specifically young mothers, among who the number one issue is\ncrime. You are a\ngraduate of Oberlin and Duke Law School. You passed up many lucrative\nopportunities to work\nin the D.A's office. You are a prosecutor with an exceptional conviction\nrecord and certainly\nnobody can hang \"soft on crime\" around your neck. You're active in local\npolitics. You're\npersonable. You are articulate and energetic. You are married and you're\nhaving a baby.\n\nSARAH\nI thought you didn't know that.\n\nSAM\nI'm sorry?\n\nSARAH\nWhen you were out in the lobby, it seemed as if you didn't know that Tom\nwas married and\nthat there was a baby on the way. And now it sounded like you already had\nthat information.\n\nSAM\nSarah, there's very little information about your husband that I don't\nhave. And tell your\nmom happy birthday for me.\n\nSarah blinks in dismay.\n\nTOM\nSam.\n\nSAM\nTom, you'll have the full weight of the Democratic National Committee,\nthe Congressional\nCampaign Committee, the Minority leader, whom we hope to make the majority\nleader, and the\nPresident of the United States. What do you say? You want to run for Congress?\n\nTOM\nThere's a lot to consider, Sam. How much time do I have to think about it?\n\nSAM\nFive minutes. I'll be outside. [leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT.

RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT\nWe get a look at the reception for the Radio Talk Show Hosts. The camera\npans down to two\nradio guys talking to C.J., who is looking confused, if not bored out of\nher mind.\n\nRADIO GUY 1\nNo, no, that was K-talk on Minneapolis. You're thinking Slam 100, sir,\nin the Great Lakes\nregion. \"The number one station with the number one sound.\"\n\nRADIO GUY 2\nBut, then it was classic rock.\n\nRADIO GUY 1\nOr at least what our program director thought was classic rock. Fleetwood Mac,\nand what not.\n\nRADIO GUY 2\nThen they switched over to news and information back in '82?\n\nRADIO GUY 1\n'82, '83.\n\nRADIO GUY 2\nWe started with \"Drive Time\", then went to the 4 hour format.\n\nRADIO GUY 1\nSay, is Howard showing up today?\n\nC.J.\n(waking up a bit) Stern.\n\nRADIO GUY 1\nI heard he was going to show up if Imus was coming and Imus wasn't showing\nup if Howard was\ncoming.\n\nRADIO GUY 2\nBy the way, I was \"Dave in the Morning\" before he was \"Imus in the\nMorning.\" But that's...\nuh... water under the bridge.\n\nC.J.\nIsn't Don Imus in this 70's?\n\nRADIO GUY 2\nI believe so, yes.\n\nC.J.\n[chuckles] How are you \"Dave in the Morning\" before he was \"Imus in the\nMorning?\"\n\nRADIO GUY 2\n(taking it seriously) It was a very painful. I don't like to talk about it.\n\nC.J.\nOkay. Fellas, I'm sorry, but it's Election Day and I need to check in with\nthe exit polls...\n\nRADIO GUY 1\nSure.\n\nC.J.\n...and what not. Good meeting you both.\n\nRADIO GUY 1\nGood talking to you, C.J.\n\nC.J. turns away as a woman in a green business suit walks in. Photographers\ntaking pictures\nand flashbulbs going off all over the place. C.J. walks up to Carol.\n\nC.J.\nWho's that?\n\nCAROL\nJenna Jacobs.\n\nC.J.\nThat's Jenna Jacobs?\n\nCAROL\nYeah. She changed her hair.\n\nC.J.\n[starts fluffing her hair] What's the latest?\n\nCAROL\n12 races too close to call. Thompson, Marinovich....\n\nC.J.\nI'm gonna go check.\n\nC.J. leaves the reception but gets one last look at JENNA JACOBS.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nBartlet is sitting in his chair going over some papers. Toby enters after\nknocking.\n\nTOBY\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nToby, I'm drinking the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted in my life:\nchocolate syrup,\ncold milk, and seltzer. I know it sounds terrible, but trust me, I don't\nknow where this\nhas been all my life.\n\nTOBY\nIt's called an egg cream, Mr. President. We invented it in Brooklyn.\n\nBARTLET\nIn Brooklyn.\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nNot New England?\n\nTOBY\nThere are some good things in this world not from New England, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nToby, don't ever let me hear you say that again.\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's on your mind?\n\nTOBY\nMr. President, I was thinking... I was thinking it might...\n\nBARTLET\nYou want to take a leave of absence.\n\nTOBY\nI was thinking I might need some time off, yes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's no problem, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nNot a problem at all.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, sir. [turns to leave]\n\nBARTLET\n15 minutes.\n\nToby turns back around to face Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's time to get up off the mat, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nSir, what's to wrong with having the Attorney General designate potentially...\n\nBARTLET\nToby.\n\nTOBY\n...dangerous organizations that promote violent acts? I... I... understand\nit's problematic.\nAh... uh... there'd be no judicial review, or legislative oversight, or even\nfor that matter\nlegal finding of fact, but... (big sigh) Okay... fine... fine... (choked up\nwith emotion)\nWhy does it feel like this? I've seen shootings before.\n\nBARTLET\n[rises from his chair] It wasn't a shooting, Toby. It was a lynching. They\ntried to lynch\nCharlie right in front of our eyes, can you believe that?\n\nBartlet puts on his glasses and roots around for a file and hands it to Toby.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's this?\n\nBARTLET\nKeyhole satellite photographs. It's the headquarters for West Virginia White\nPride\nheadquarters. It's a diner outside Blacksberg. Every night for the past 12\nweeks,\nI've picked up the phone and called the Attorney General, fully prepared to\nsay two\nwordstake 'em. And then I hang up the phone because I know it'll be better\ntomorrow\nand better the day after that. We saw a lynching, Toby. That's why it feels\nlike this.\n\nTOBY\nI'm not sure I'm going to come out of the other side of this.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm not sure I can either. But until we are sure, I think we should keep\ncoming into work\nevery day. [sits back down]\n\nTOBY\nHow's it going with your school board guy?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, he's gonna win.\n\nTOBY\nWhen you ran against him, how'd you beat him?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't remember. I've been thinking about it for weeks, but I honestly\ndon't remember.\n\nKnock at the door and Sam enters.\n\nSAM\nExcuse me, Mr. President. Good evening.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nI wasn't sure whether you'd be stopping by the Talk Radio reception. I\nscratched out a few\nremarks for you.\n\nBARTLET\nLet me look at them while we walk. Toby, go with us, to this radio thing.\n\nTOBY\nOh God, really sir?\n\nBARTLET\nThere'll be crab puffs. New England crab puffs, by the way, made in New\nEngland.\n\nSAM\nActually, it's Alaskan crab.\n\nTOBY\nSam.\n\nBARTLET\nThere's Alaskan crab in this White House?\n\nTOBY\nHe wouldn't have known the difference.\n\nBARTLET\nHave you tried them?\n\nSAM\nI... yes, reluctantly. I think it was clear the way I ate the crab puffs\nthat it was a gesture\nof protest.\n\nBARTLET\nWere they good?\n\nSAM\nExtraordinarily good and going very fast.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's get there.\n\nThunder rumbles outside.\n\nCUT TO: INT. RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT\nA waiter walks by with a platter of crab puffs. Photographers taking pictures\nof various\nguests. The camera pans up to C.J. talking with another radio personality.\n\nGARY\nI call myself Gary with a \"G\".\n\nC.J.\nHow else would you spell \"Gary\"?\n\nGARY\nNo other way. I'm saying, that's what I call myself. Therefore, \"Gary with a\n\"G\", talking to\nyou on KADR AM.\"\n\nC.J.\nLike Liza with a \"Z\".\n\nGARY\nExactly. Hokey? Maybe so, but I have 900,000 listeners in the Rocky Mountain\nregion.\n\nA Secret Service Agent catches C.J.'s eye.\n\nC.J.\nWould you excuse me?\n\nC.J. leaves Gary with a \"G\" and makes her way into the center of the room\nto introduce the\nPresident.\n\nC.J.\nExcuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. The President of the\nUnited States.\n\nEveryone stands and claps. The flashbulbs go off as Bartlet enters the\nreception.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you. Thank you, very much. Thanks a lot. I wish I could spend more\nthan a few minutes\nwith you but the polls don't close in the east for another hour and there\nare plenty of\nelection results left to falsify.\n\nEveryone chuckles.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know with so many people participating in the political and social debate\nthrough call\nin shows, it's a good idea to be reminded...\n\nBartlet loses his train of thought when something attracts his attention. The\ncamera pans over\nto Jenna Jacobs, sitting on her chair.\n\nBARTLET\n...it's a good idea to be reminded of the awesome impact... the awesome\nimpact...\n\nHe finally gives up and addresses her.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry, um... you're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right?\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's good to have you here.\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nThank you.\n\nBARTLET\nThe awesome impact of the airwaves and how that translates into the furthering\nof our national\ndiscussions but obviously also how it can... how it can...\n\nHe sighs, and addresses Jenna Jacobs again.\n\nBARTLET\nForgive me, Dr. Jacobs. Are you an M.D.?\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nPh.D.\n\nBARTLET\nA Ph.D.?\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIn Psychology?\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nNo sir.\n\nBARTLET\nTheology?\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nSocial work?\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nI have a Ph.D. in English Literature.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm asking, 'cause on your show, people call in for advice and you go by\nthe name of\nDr. Jacobs on your show. And I didn't know if maybe your listeners were\nconfused by that,\nand assumed you had advanced training in Psychology, Theology, or health care.\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nI don't believe they are confused, no sir.\n\nBARTLET\nGood. I like your show. I like how you call homosexuality an abomination.\n\nJENNA JACOBS\nI don't say homosexuality is an abomination, Mr. President. The Bible does.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, it does. Leviticus.\n\nJENNA JACOBS\n18:22\n\nBARTLET\nChapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had\nyou here.\nI'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned\nin Exodus 21:7.\n(small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent\nItalian, and\nalways clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for\nher be? While\nthinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry,\ninsists on working\non the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I\nmorally obligated\nto kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really\nimportant,\n'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a\ndead pig makes\nus unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington\nRedskins\nstill play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town\nreally have to be\ntogether to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by\nside? Can I burn\nmy mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two\ndifferent threads?\n\nJenna Jacobs fidgets uncomfortably.\n\nBARTLET\nThink about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be\nmistaking this\nfor your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building,\nwhen the President\nstands, nobody sits.\n\nJenna Jacobs squirms in her seat but doesn't rise. Bartlet glares meaningfully\nat her.\nShe finally rises out of her seat.\n\nBARTLET\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nYes, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's how I beat him.\n\nBartlet leaves the reception. Toby and Jenna Jacobs exchange glances before\nToby leaves.\nSam approaches her, who is holding a plate of hors d'oeuvre.\n\nSAM\nI'm just... I'm gonna take that crab puff.\n\nSam snatches up a crab puff off of her plate and leaves. She smiles awkwardly\naround.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nCamera shot of a TV monitor and pans up to Charlie walking toward his desk.\n\nJEFFREY (OS)\nYou want one of my animal crackers?\n\nJeffrey is sitting in Mrs. Landingham's chair.\n\nJEFFREY\nI have elephants and I have lions.\n\nANDREW\n[enters] You bugging the man?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, we're okay. Is there a software problem again?\n\nANDREW\nI think I got it. Just want to run a few programs and then I'll be out of\nhere.\n(sits down) Pretty busy day around here, huh?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. My name is Charlie Young, by the way.\n\nANDREW\nYou don't think I don't know who you are? Man who almost got the President\nkilled?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. That's going to look good on my resume.\n\nANDREW\nI'll just be a minute.\n\nLightning flashes outside.\n\nCHARLIE\nMy mother used to work nights, too.\n\nANDREW\nI'm sorry?\n\nCHARLIE\nMy mother used to work nights, too.\n\nANDREW\nWas she a nurse?\n\nCHARLIE\nA police officer.\n\nANDREW\nIs she gone?\n\nCHARLIE\nShe was shot and killed in the line a year ago, June. Ironically, she wasn't\nsupposed to be\non the shift. She switched shifts that day 'cause I asked her to.\n\nLong pause as they look at each other.\n\nANDREW\nHey, Charlie... um... you know what I think she'd say if she was here,\nright now?\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat?\n\nANDREW\nSame thing my father would say, \"if they're shooting at you, you know you're\ndoing\nsomething right.\"\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah. (beat) Yeah. (more lightening flashes and rumbles) ...yeah.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT\nZoey is sitting in a chair on a balcony, reading a book. Charlie approaches\nher.\n\nCHARLIE\nExcuse me, aren't you Zoey Bartlet?\n\nZoey gives a small smile and gets up to kiss Charlie\n\nZOEY\nIt's too much to happen to someone your age. Your father and your mother\nand then this...\nI don't know, Charlie. I mean... what do you do?\n\nCHARLIE\nI was going to go vote.\n\nZOEY\nI could come.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nLeo walks by.\n\nLEO\nHi.\n\nZOEY\nHi, Leo.\n\nLEO\nCharlie, I'm looking for the President.\n\nCHARLIE\nIs there anything wrong?\n\nLEO\nNo, no... I... um.... I think he may have done a couple of numbers at the\nTalk Radio reception.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay. Zoey and I are going out. I'll be on my pager.\n\nLEO\nYou're going out?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nCharlie, you're taking extra protection, right?\n\nCharlie is a bit taken aback by that suggestion.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, Leo....\n\nLEO\nSecret Service protection, Charlie. But thanks for loading me up with that\nimage.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, we'll have extra protection.\n\nLEO\nOkay. Something about a dead pig's skin. I need to find him.\n\nLeo walks away as Charlie and Zoey looks confusingly at each other.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT STOOP - NIGHT\nIn a tree lined sidewalk, C.J., Josh and Donna are sitting on a stoop of\none of the townhouses\nlining the sidewalk. Sam is nearby in a car talking on his cell phone.\n\nSAM\n(into phone) Okay.\n\nToby comes out of Josh's apartment and hands C.J. a bottle of beer.\n\nJOSH\nEverybody should have to stay inside for three months so that they truly\nappreciate the\noutdoors. I appreciate the outdoors, now. I'm an outdoorsman.\n\nDONNA\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nI said I'd let you outside if you'd stop talking about being an outdoorsman\nand if you\nstopped talking about Theoretical Physics.\n\nJOSH\n(to C.J.) Aha! You'd thought I'd forget about it, didn't you? Banner headline,\n5 days ago.\nModel for the Unified Theory solved. Banner headline in the New York Times. You\nsaid it wasn't\ngoing to be news.\n\nC.J.\nHey! You're wearing my pajamas.\n\nJOSH\nYes, I am.\n\nC.J.\nTake your coat off, let's see.\n\nJosh stands up and shrugs off his coat to reveal oversized light blue pajamas\nthat are three\nsizes too big.\n\nC.J.\nThose are too big.\n\nJOSH\nYes, they are. All this time I've been working with you, did you also think\nI was playing\npower forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers?\n\nC.J.\nI think they look good on you. (grabs Toby's arms)\n\nTOBY\nI think you're all freaks.\n\nSam gets off the phone and out of the car and approaches the stoop.\n\nTOBY\nWhat do you have?\n\nSAM\nYou're not going to believe it.\n\nC.J.\nHow'd they go?\n\nSAM\nTwelve races, in none of them did the incumbent win. In none of them, did\nthe party that\npreviously held the seat win. You know how it went? Seven to five.\n\nJOSH\nYou're kidding.\n\nC.J.\nSeven republicans and five democrats?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nThe house stayed the same?\n\nEveryone looks at each other.\n\nJOSH\nAfter four months and 400 million dollars, everything stayed the same.\n\nSAM\nYup.\n\nJOSH\nTell me democracy doesn't have a sense of humor. We sit here, we drink this\nbeer out here\non the stoop, in violation about 47 city ordinances. I don't know, Toby,\nit's election night.\nWhat do you say about a government that goes out of its way to protect even\ncitizens that try\nto destroy it?\n\nTOBY\nGod bless America.\n\nSAM\n(beat) God bless America.\n\nC.J.\nGod bless America.\n\nDONNA\nGod bless America.\n\nJOSH\nGod bless America.\n\nThey all clink their bottles before the camera pulls away from the stoop.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

Don't try to know more than you do. My show is\nnot the place\nfor you to become a star.\n\nAINSLEY\nOkay.\n\nMARK\nYou'll be opposite Sam Seaborn. He's done the show a couple dozen times;\nthe White House\nwouldn't keep sending him if he didn't keep wiping the floor with whoever's\nin your chair.\n\nAINSLEY\nI've seen him.\n\nMARK\n[pointing at her] Don't be scared.\n\nAINSLEY\n[smiling] I'll try.\n\nMark comes around the desk to sit down, and Ainsley sits too.\n\nMARK\nI'll step in, and I'll take some of the punches for you if it gets out of\nhand, but if\nyou don't get too far from the talking points I'm sure that somebody will\ngive you.

A\nT.V. screen\nlights up with the Capital Beat logo.\n\nANNOUNCER [VO]\nCapital Beat with Mark Gottfried. Tonight from the right, Republican political\nanalyst\nAinsley Hayes, and from the left, White House Senior Advisor Sam Seaborn. With\nChris\nEisen at the Pentagon, and Marjorie Clarke in New York. [Lights go on.]\n\nMARK\nGood evening. Before we get to Chris and Marjorie tonight on the Capital Beat,\nthe House\nis expected to vote next week on President Bartlet's one point five billion\ndollar\neducation package. Sam Seaborn: Why is this bill better than its Republican\ncounterpart\nthat the President vetoed last year?\n\nAinsley takes up a pen ready to take notes.\n\nSAM\nBecause it buys things the teachers need. Like textbooks. In a fairly\ncomprehensive study\nthat was done, an alarmingly high number of teachers - forty percent of\nteachers in\nKirkwood, Oregon, for instance, and Kirkwood, Oregon being a fair model for\npublic school\ndistricts across the country - forty percent of the teachers in Kirkwood,\nOregon report\nnot having sufficient textbooks for their students. [Ainsley is taking\nnotes.]\nThe package offered by the Republican controlled Congress offered a grand\ntotal of zero\ndollars for new textbooks.\n\nMARK\nAinsley Hayes? Is that true?\n\nAINSLEY\n[still writing] No, it's not.\n\nMARK\nIs Sam Seaborn lying?\n\nAINSLEY\nLying's an awfully strong word...\n\nMARK\nDo you...?\n\nAINSLEY\n[finally looking up] Yes, he's lying.\n\nSAM\nI don't...\n\nAINSLEY\n[talking over him] And we should tell the truth about education.\n\nSAM\nWell, if you're gonna call...\n\nAINSLEY\nThe bill contained plenty of money for new textbooks. Also computer literacy,\nschool\nsafety, physical plants. The difference is we wanted to give the money\ndirectly to\ncommunities, and let them decide how best to spend it, on the off-chance\nthat the\nneeds of Lincoln High in Dayton are different from the needs of Crenshaw\nHigh in\nSouth Central L.A.\n\nMARK\nSam, why did the President veto the bill?\n\nSAM\nThere are...\n\nAINSLEY\n[talking over him] Because it guaranteed by law that ninety-five percent of\nthe money go\ndirectly into the classroom and bypassed the pork-barrel buffet, which is\ntroubling to\nthis President because he doesn't work for the students...\n\nSAM\n[quietly] Well that's just...\n\nAINSLEY\n...and he doesn't work for the parents of the students. He works for the\nteacher's union.\n\nSAM\nThe difference with the old...\n\nHe and Mark exchange wry smiles as Ainsley interrupts again.\n\nAINSLEY\nThe bill contains plenty of money for textbooks, Mark, and anyone who says\notherwise is\nflat-out lying. And we should tell the truth about textbooks. Textbooks are\nimportant, if\nfor no other reason than they'd accurately place the town of Kirkwood in\nCalifornia and\nnot in Oregon.\n\nMARK\n[to the camera] And we're in business. We'll be back with more Capital Beat\nafter this.\n\nDIRECTOR [VO]\nOut.\n\nThe T.V. screen goes black and displays the words PLACE COMMERCIAL HERE.\n\nAINSLEY\nI'm sorry, did I overreach?\n\nMark chuckles and gets up, leaning over Sam.\n\nMARK\nHey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nMARK\nThis one might know something.\n\nSAM\n[quietly] Yeah.

They can\ncharge what they\nwant for their products.\n\nTOBY\nIt sounds to me like we intend to be soft on the drug companies.\n\nC.J.\nToby, I don't think anybody expects this White House to be anything but\ntough on American\ncompanies showing a profit.\n\nTOBY\nDamn right.\n\nToby comes to a stop in the doorway of C.J.'S OFFICE.

My\ngirlfriends and I go\nfor the spring fashions.\n\nTOBY\nIt shows.\n\nC.J. turns to give him a look and he goes off down a side corridor. A young\nreporter,\nBill, comes up behind her.\n\nBILL\nC.J..\n\nC.J.\n[pointing in the direction Toby went] He just made a little dig about my\nclothes, and\nthat's what's gonna be with me the rest of the day.\n\nBILL\nC.J., I wanted to introduce myself, I'm Bill Kelley from the Cleveland\nCourier?\n\nC.J.\n[shaking his hand] Hi.\n\nBILL\nThey're breaking me in to cover for Tom Johnson, I've been sitting in the\nback.\n\nC.J.\nWelcome.\n\nBILL\nCan I ask you something?\n\nC.J.\nThat's what I'm here for.\n\nBILL\nDo you know anything about Bonamo Energy selling drilling equipment to Iraq?\n\nC.J.\nI'm not gonna wave you off the story, but I can't tell you anything about it.\n\nBILL\n[stopping her] If they were selling the Iraqis drilling equipment, that\nwould be in\nviolation of sanctions, wouldn't it?\n\nC.J.\nGrand jury investigations are secret, Bill. I can't tell you any more about\nit.\n\nBILL\nI understand. Nice meeting you.\n\nC.J.\nNice meeting you.\n\nShe walks on and then freezes in sudden realization. She turns.\n\nC.J.\nBill!\n\nBILL\nYeah?\n\nC.J.\nNothing.

One of them lives right\nhere in the U.S.\nHe realized that vital elements could be harvested from the stalk of the\nwheat. In his\nhands, India, which at the time had been ravaged by drought and overpopulation\n- in his\nhands, the wheat crop increased from 11 million tons to 60 million tons\nannually.\n\nBARTLET\n[nodding] That's right. His name is Norman Borlaug, by the way, and he won\nthe Nobel\nPeace Prize in 1970.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mr. President, President Nimbala. Thank you everyone. The press\nstart to\ndisperse.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Nimbala] I think you're absolutely right about the kind of miracle we\nneed. I think\nwe're gonna make a lot of progress in the next few days.\n\nNIMBALA\nI hope so, Mr. President. My country's dying.\n\nBartlet looks down for a moment, then nods in acknowlegement and turns to\nleave.\nLeo catches up with him as he walks back to THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nBARTLET\nIt was called dwarf wheat, which produces heavy yields without its stalk\nfalling over\nfrom the weight of the rain.\n\nLEO\nWas it a hybrid?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat am I, Farmer Bob? It was wheat, and there was more than there used to\nbe.\n\nLEO\nOkay!\n\nBARTLET\nAnd hire that girl.\n\nLEO\nWhat girl?\n\nBARTLET\nAinsley Hayes.\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\n'Cause this is one of those things you're excited about after breakfast that\nyou forget\nyou told me to do by lunch.\n\nBARTLET\n[waggling a finger at him] Not one of those.\n\nLEO\nIt's one of those.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, as hard as you might try, the Republican Party isn't going anywhere.\n\nLEO\nYou don't know that for sure, sir, they could all end up moving to Vancouver.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't think so.\n\nLEO\nMe neither, but being in power means everybody else can take a seat for four\nyears.\n\nCharlie comes in and hands Bartlet a mug as he sits at his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie, I want to hire a woman whose voice I think would fit in nicely\naround here,\nshe's a conservative Republican. Do you think I should do it?\n\nCHARLIE\nAbsolutely, Mr. President. 'Cause I'm told that theirs is the party of\ninclusion.\n\nBartlet gives him a look as he moves away.\n\nLEO\n[gesturing over his shoulder at him] See? Charlie just made a joke to you\nin the Oval\nOffice. That's how bad an idea it is.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo.\n\nLEO\nSeriously, Mr. President, if you want to do this, it's not an uninteresting\nnotion,\nlet's just do it in a more high-profile place. Put a Republican in the\ncabinet.\n\nBARTLET\nWe might do that, Leo. A hundred million Republicans; we might hire as many\nas two of\nthem. But for now, hire this girl.\n\nLEO\nTo do what?\n\nBARTLET\n[shrugging] I don't know. She's a lawyer. Put her in the counsel's office.\n\nLEO\nYou really want me to do this?\n\nBARTLET\nYes.\n\nLEO\nWhat if she doesn't want to work here?\n\nBARTLET\nAppeal to her sense of duty. And smooth it over with the staff. Really,\nI don't want to\nhear from them.\n\nLEO\nShe can always have my job, you know.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, she can.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nLeo leaves.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen they close the book on me and you, it will say that at this moment you\nwere not\nthere for me, and for that, obviously, there'll be some kind of punishment.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, you could sing Puccini for me again, Mr. President.

His father was\nState Chairman\nof the North Carolina Republican Party.\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhen I was young, I was a Young Republican.\n\nLEO\n[sitting up] Yeah, Ainsley, even if you hadn't already told me all of this,\nyou know,\nmany, many times, I would know it anyway, 'cause I have this FBI file.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou have my FBI file?\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nAINSLEY\nI can't believe that! You have my FBI file?\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nAINSLEY\nI have an FBI file?\n\nLEO\nAinsley...\n\nAINSLEY\nMr. McGarry, I loathe almost everything you believe in. [stands up]\n\nLEO\nWhere are you going?\n\nAINSLEY\nI'm not going anywhere, I'm standing up, which is how one speaks in opposition\nin a\ncivilized world.\n\nLEO\nWell, you go, girl.\n\nAINSLEY\nI find this administration smug and patronizing, and under the impression\nthat those who\ndisagree with them are less than they are, and with colder hearts.\n\nLEO\nI don't think that's true.\n\nAINSLEY\nHow many people on your staff assumed that I was ambitious, mean, and stupid?\n\nLEO\n[firmly] None. [after a moment] C.J. Cregg thinks you kill your pets. You\ndon't do that,\ndo you?\n\nAINSLEY\nNo, I don't kill my pets. I don't have any pets. I was thinking about getting\na pet,\nbut-- that doesn't matter. The point is...\n\nLEO\nAinsley.\n\nAINSLEY\nYes, sir.\n\nLEO\nDon't you want to work in the White House?\n\nAINSLEY\nOh, only since I was two.\n\nLEO\n[shrugging] Okay.\n\nAINSLEY\nIt has to be this White House?\n\nLEO\nAinsley...\n\nAINSLEY\nMr. McGarry.\n\nLEO\nThe President likes smart people who disagree with him. He wants to hear\nfrom you.\nThe President's asking you to serve. And everything else is crap.\n\nHe gets up and goes to open the door for her.\n\nLEO\nThink about it overnight. Come back here at six tomorrow and give me your\nanswer.\n[shouting] Margaret!\n\nMargaret jumps, standing right in the doorway as he yanks it open.\n\nLEO\nHow you doin'?

HALLWAY - DAY\nToby pushes through a door, carrying a drink with a wrapped-up danish on\ntop of it.\nJosh follows behind him, eating a banana.\n\nJOSH\nYou're listening to me, but you're not understanding me.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I'm disagreeing with you. That doesn't mean I'm not listening to you, or\nunderstanding what you're saying. I'm doing all three at the same time.\n\nJOSH\nYou gotta get out of their face, Toby, they can get up any time they want. We\ndon't have\nanything they need. [tosses his banana skin in a trash can as they walk past]\n\nTOBY\nThey need patent treaties to be enforced.\n\nJOSH\nAnd they are gonna be enforced. The pharmaceutical companies got half the\nHouse of\nRepresentatives elected. Congress is gonna get serious about this.\n\nTOBY\nThe pills cost 'em four cents a unit to make.\n\nJOSH\nYou know that's not true. The second pill cost 'em four cents; the first\npill cost 'em\nfour hundred million dollars.\n\nTOBY\nThey also enjoy unprecedented tax breaks, foreign tax credits, research and\nexperimentation exemptions, and expensing of research expenditures. To say\nnothing\nof the fact that business is pretty good, so they're gonna cover their butt.\n\nToby pushes through the door of the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE and hands the\nwrapped danish\nto Ginger.\n\nJOSH\nTell me about Nimbala.\n\nHe walks on past as Toby stops to talk to Ginger.\n\nTOBY\nThey didn't have cheese.\n\nGINGER\nWhat is it?\n\nTOBY\nIt's boysenberry.\n\nGINGER\nA boysenberry danish?\n\nTOBY\n[walking away] It's new.\n\nJosh is sitting waiting for him in TOBY'S OFFICE.\n\nJOSH\nTell me about Nimbala.\n\nTOBY\nHe's a good President, Josh. He was a great soldier, a brilliant commander,\nhe led his\npeople for 28 years, he can't get ahead of the curve. He's cursed by\ngeography. You know\nwhat, if the ground won't grow anything, you don't have an economy. Still,\nhe stands in\na room and he talks about Norman Borlaug. He came here himself, Josh, he\ndidn't send\ndelegates. I think it's 'cause he doesn't have any. I think he's holding\nhis country\ntogether with both hands.\n\nJOSH\nThen let's make sure we send him back with something, is my point.\n\nGinger appears in the doorway.\n\nGINGER\nFellas?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nGINGER\nThey're ready.\n\nJosh gets up to leave.\n\nTOBY\n[quietly] Yeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY\n\nCAROL [OS]\nFolks, please take your seats.\n\nC.J.\nGood afternoon. Guess what? The aduit figures released yesterday by the\nSenate Finance\ncomfirmed earlier reports released by the Congressional Budget Office\nregarding the\nincreased budget projections.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BACK OF PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nAinsley wanders in.\n\nC.J. [OS]\nThe CBO's projection actually increased the surplus amount from two trillion\nover the\nnext ten years to 2.2 trillion\n\nWe see C.J. on a monitor as Ainsley comes up beside Bill.\n\nC.J.\nThis exceeds even the most optimistic estimates published last year by the\nWhite House\nbudget office of 300 billion and the CBO's projection last quarter of 900\nbillion.\n\nBILL\nAre you new too?\n\nAINSLEY\n[leaning closer] Excuse me?\n\nBILL\nAre you new too? It's my fourth day.\n\nAINSLEY\nUh no, no.\n\nBILL\nMaybe you can help me, then. I'm trying to get somewhere with drilling\nequipment that\nmight have been sold by Bonamo Energy to the Iraqis, in violation of\nsanctions. I asked\nC.J. about it, and she said there's a grand jury investigation, and she's\nnot allowed to\ntalk. If you ask he she was acting a little bit-- [shrugs] Ah, I don't\nknow. But I hear\nshe hasn't been able to sleep, and maybe that's because...\n\nAINSLEY\nShe told you there was a grand jury investigation?\n\nBILL\nYeah.\n\nMargaret comes up behind them.\n\nMARGARET\nMiss Hayes.\n\nAINSLEY\nYeah.\n\nMARGARET\nThis way.\n\nThey leave and Bill watches them go.\n\nC.J.

WHITE HOUSE - DAY\nFRIDAY\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nALAN\nI think there's a more fundamental problem than marginal costs. We've been\nat this for\nfour days and I still think we haven't talked about the fundamental\nmisunderstanding in\nAfrica over the basic facts of AIDS.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nI don't think there's a misunderstanding.\n\nALAN\nA week ago you people stood up and said that AIDS has only a casual\nrelationship to HIV.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nI'm not sure to whom you are referring when you say, 'you people', but it\nwas President\nMbeki of South Africa who said that, and not anyone in this room.\n\nSPOKESMAN 2\nI think Mr. Damson has brought up a hard truth that should faced.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's that?\n\nALAN\nIf tomorrow we made AIDS medication free to every patient in your country,\nas much as\nthey needed for as long as they needed it, it would likely make very little\ndifference\nin the spread of the epidemic.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nSPOKESMAN 2\nAnti-HIV drugs are a triple cocktail. It's a complicated regimen that requires\nten pills\nto be taken every day at precise times. Two protease inhibitors every eight\nhours, two\ncombination RTI pills every twelve hours.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's the problem?\n\nThere is a brief silence. Toby sighs.\n\nTOBY\nThey don't own wristwatches. They can't tell time.\n\nJosh rubs his temples, looking tired. There is another brief silence.\n\nALAN\nWe agree that something must be done. But we don't think we're culprits,\nand we don't\nthink there is an easy or obvious solution. And we think you should be aware\nof the\ndangers involved in some of the proposals made here today.\n\nToby sighs again.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President, may we speak with you alone, please?\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nMargaret and Ainsley are walking along together. Ainsley stops, spotting\nC.J. exercising\non the Lifecycle in her office.\n\nMARGARET\nAinsley?\n\nAINSLEY\nCould-could you give me just a moment?\n\nMargaret checks her watch.\n\nMARGARET\nSure.\n\nAINSLEY\nThank you.\n\nAinsley walks and enters C.J.'S OFFICE.\n\nAINSLEY\nExcuse me. I was going to see Leo McGarry. He asked me to come back and see\nhim again at\nthe end of the day. I'm Ainsley Hayes.\n\nC.J.\nIt's good to meet you.\n\nAINSLEY\nI'm not taking the job, C.J.\n\nC.J.\nWell... [shrugging] okay.\n\nAINSLEY\nI just wanted to... okay.\n\nAinsley turns to go as C.J. takes a swig of water, then she turns back.\n\nAINSLEY\nC.J., rule 6[e] of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure says you can be\nprosecuted\nfor even confirming that a grand jury's been impaneled.\n\nC.J.\nHow'd you know?\n\nAINSLEY\nA reporter in your press room, who hasn't read the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\nC.J.\nWell, someone's gonna tell him eventually.\n\nAINSLEY\nWho told you?\n\nC.J.\nOne of the witnesses who was called. What could happen?\n\nAINSLEY\nEighteen months, medium security. [C.J. abruptly stops pedalling.] C.J.,\nI'm kidding.\nYou didn't break the law. Attorneys and jurors are under a gag order. Witnesses\nare free\nto say whatever they want, and anyone is free to repeat what they've said. You\nknow, I'm\nnot sure that laying low and hoping nobody noticed was the best strategy\nhere. Next time,\nyou should really run it by someone in the Counsel's Office. Anyway, I should\ngo see Leo.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY\nNimbala is watching the rain against the window. Josh and Toby enter the\nroom behind him.\n\nTOBY\nPresident Nimbala?\n\nNimbala walks over to the seats and sits down.\n\nTOBY\nI'm gonna put a deal together, and I want you to agree to it.\n\nNIMBALA\nWhat am I agreeing to?\n\nTOBY\nI can get them to lower their prices - but you have to commit your military,\nyour customs\nbureau, and your Ministry of Health. You have to commit them to stopping\nthe influx of\nblack market HIV drugs from Korea and Pakistan, and from wherever else\nthey're coming.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\n35.8 percent of our adult population is infected. 60 percent of our hospital\nbeds are\noccupied by people who are HIV-positive. Our Institute of Policy Analysis\nsays in the\ncoming decade, 50 percent of all households in our country will have at\nleast one member\ninfected with HIV. To think I would care about International Patent Law at\na time like\nthis is unrealistic.\n\nJOSH\nMr. President. The U.S. Department of Commerce will put your country on a\nwatch list.\nThat's the first step towards trade sanctions. Our Congress could end all\naid to your\ncountry.\n\nTOBY\nOr you can agree to what we're saying. In exchange for which we believe we\ncan get\nCongress to forgive the debt, and all your past development loans, and we\nbelieve the\nExport-Import Bank will offer a billion dollars in loans to finance the\npurchase of\nAmerican AIDS medication.\n\nNIMBALA\n[disbelieving] Congress won't approve the loan!\n\nJOSH\nCongress won't have to, sir. The Treasury and the State Department will\nreview it, but\nif we spread the loans out over several countries in your region on a\ncase-by-case basis,\nand if none of the loans exceed a hundred million dollars, we don't need\nCongressional\napproval. That law might change soon.\n\nThe translator finishes relaying and Nimbala is silent for a moment.\n\nNIMBALA\nIt's a terrible thing to beg for your life. Terrible. My father- [slips back\ninto his\nown language]\n\nTRANSLATOR\n[to Nimbala] A proud man.\n\nNIMBALA\nProud? Ah. My father was a proud man. He built homes. He wouldn't like what\nI came here\nto do.\n\nTOBY\nYes he would, Mr. President. I swear to God, he would.\n\nNIMBALA\n[after a long silence] Thank you, sir.\n\nTOBY\n[to Josh] Go tell Leo.\n\nJosh gets up and leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTSIDE LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\nAinsley is studying a picture on the wall. Sam walks past carrying a folder. He\npokes\nhis head through Leo's door, sees he's not there, and then turns back and\nnotices her.\n\nSAM\nHi.\n\nAINSLEY\n[turning] Hi.\n\nSam looks at his watch and fiddles awkwardly with his tie. He opens his\nfolder to look\nat it. After a moment, Ainsley turns back to the picture.\n\nSAM\n[abruptly] You know, something you forgot to mention about the 95 percent\nof the money\ngoing straight into the classroom and past the pork-barrel buffet is that\nthe school only\ngot the money if they agreed not to distribute condoms.\n\nAINSLEY\nWell that's a reason to veto it, because the thing our public schools need\nmore than\nanything else right now are free condoms. I'd... definitely make that priority\none.\n\nJOSH\n[walking past into Leo's office] Hey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nHey.\n\nJOSH\n[emerging] Where's Leo?\n\nAINSLEY\nHe's not here.\n\nJosh pauses for a moment in the doorway.\n\nJOSH\nYou look familiar to me. [realizing] You're Ainsley Hayes!\n\nAINSLEY\nAinsley, uh, with an 'n'.\n\nSAM\nShe works here now.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nLeo hired her.\n\nJOSH\nWhat're you talking about?\n\nSAM\nLeo hired her. He told me and C.J., he was waiting to tell you and Toby.\n\nJOSH\nWhat was he waiting for?\n\nSAM\n[exasperated] How the hell do I know, Josh?\n\nAINSLEY\nWaiting until he hired me, which he hasn't done, 'cause I'm not taking the\njob.\n\nJOSH\nYou're not taking the job?\n\nAINSLEY\nNo. But thank you for talking to me, instead of about me.\n\nJOSH\nHey, I'm still back on he offered you the job... but you're not taking the\njob?\n\nSAM\nNo, man, why participate in the process when you can get a job commenting\non it?\n\nAINSLEY\nYou think because I don't want to work here it's because I can get a better\ngig on\nGeraldo? Gosh, let's see if there could possibly be any other reason why I\nwouldn't want\nto work in this White House? This White House that feels that government is\nbetter for\nchildren than parents are. That looks at forty years of degrading and\nhumiliating free\nlunches handed out in a spectacularly failed effort to level the playing\nfield and says,\n'Let's try forty more.' This White House that says of anyone that points\nthat out to\nthem, that they are cold and mean and racist, and then accuses Republicans\nof using the\npolitics of fear. This White House that loves the Bill of Rights, all of\nthem - except\nthe second one.\n\nSAM\n[looks at Josh nervously] This is the wrong place to talk about guns right\nnow. I thought\nyour column was idiotic.\n\nAINSLEY\nImagine my surprise.\n\nSAM\n[getting steadily more emotional] But for a brilliant surgical team and two\ncentimeters\nof a miracle, this guy's dead right now. From bullets fired from a gun bought\nlegally.\nThey bought guns, they loaded them, they drove from Wheeling to Rosslyn,\nand until they\npulled the trigger they had yet to commit a crime. I am so off-the-charts\ntired of the\ngun lobby tossing around words like 'personal freedom' and no one calling\n'em on it.\n[Josh moves away uncomfortably.] It's not about personal freedom, and it\ncertainly has\nnothing to do with public safety. It's just that some people like guns.\n\nAINSLEY\nYes, they do. But you know what's more insidious than that? Your gun control\nposition\ndoesn't have anything to do with public safety, and it's certainly not about\npersonal\nfreedom. It's about you don't like people who do like guns. You don't like\nthe people.\nThink about that, the next time you make a joke about the South.\n\nTOBY\n[coming in] Where's Leo?\n\nSAM\n[still focused on Ainsley] What?\n\nTOBY\nWhere's Leo?\n\nJOSH\nWe don't know.\n\nCharlie appears briefly in the doorway to hand a piece of paper to Toby.\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, you seen Leo?\n\nToby hands the paper to Josh and leaves. Josh reads it and then hands it to\nSam, and\nthey both go off in different directions.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nJosh opens the door from Leo's office and goes in. Bartlet and Leo are at\nthe desk\nwhile various other people bustle about.

They're coming back.\n\nAnother aide opens the door for Nimbala.\n\nBARTLET\n[nodding towards him] Leo.\n\nLEO\n[to the military advisors] Excuse us. [louder] Excuse me, everybody, could\nwe have the\nroom a moment please?\n\nThe various aides and advisors clear out. Sam enters behind Nimbala.\n\nLEO\nSam.\n\nSam closes the door behind him. Bartlet slips on his suit jacket and looks\ngrave as he\nturns to face Nimbala.\n\nBARTLET\nMr. President, three hours ago there was a coup in your country. The AFRC\nhas taken the\ncapital.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nWhere are my children?\n\nBARTLET\nWe're finding out. The information's coming very quickly now from our people\nin Angola\nand Sudan. Mr. President, I think you should sit.\n\nNIMBALA\nNo, thank you. I'll go now.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, no, sir! My State Department is offering you asylum in the U.S.\n\nNIMBALA\nThank you, Mr. President, but I have to go home!\n\nBARTLET\nYou can't go home. You can't go home!\n\nNIMBALA\nI'm their leader.\n\nBARTLET\nThey have the capital, they have the radio station, they have the television\nstation.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nAre there Americans on the ground?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm evacuating the embassy.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nHave they closed the airports?\n\nBARTLET\nYes.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nThey'll want to arrest me. They will want to put me on trial. You should\ntrade my return\nfor the safe departure of the Americans.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't need to trade you! If they won't give me the Americans, we'll go\nand get 'em\nourselves, and they know that, and they'll let 'em go.\n\nAinsley approaches from Leo's office and sees them talking through the door.\n\nNIMBALA\n[firmly] I'd like to call my embassy.\n\nTOBY\nYour embassy is in exile, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThey will shoot you the moment you step off the plane.\n\nAnother aide comes in and hands Bartlet a message.\n\nTRANSLATOR [NIMBALA]\nPlease tell me what is in that message.\n\nBartlet puts on his glasses and reads for a moment, then looks up.\n\nBARTLET\nWe think your brother and your two sons are already dead. We think your wife\nis being\nhidden in Kenya. You understand, don't you, why I can't offer military\nassistance?\n\nNIMBALA\nYes.\n\nMargaret comes up to where Ainsley is standing and leads her away.\n\nBARTLET\nSit down, sir.\n\nMargaret closes the door.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT\nCUT TO: INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS\nBruce and Harriet are sitting together.\n\nHARRIET\nAnd you know they just wanted to hire her so they could say they did.\n\nBRUCE\nYes. Look at us! We hired a Republican! Look at how bipartisan we are! We\ndidn't even\nnotice that she looks like a Gap dancer!\n\nAinsley approaches and joins them.\n\nHARRIET\nAinsley!\n\nBRUCE\nHey.\n\nHARRIET\nBruce was just telling me.\n\nBRUCE\nI couldn't resist.\n\nHARRIET\nHe said they tried to hire you.\n\nBRUCE\n[eagerly] Tell me about the look on McGarry's face.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhat?\n\nBRUCE\nWhen you said no.\n\nAINSLEY\nI, um, couldn't see him. He had to- he was called in to-\n\nHARRIET\nWhat's wrong?\n\nAINSLEY\n[shaking her head] Nothing. He had to- Something happened.\n\nBRUCE\nUh, damn. I wanted you to say it to his face. I wanted to see...\n\nHARRIET\nI hate these people.\n\nBRUCE\nDid you meet anyone there who isn't worthless?\n\nAINSLEY\n[quietly] Don't say that.\n\nBRUCE\nDid you meet anyone there who has any-?\n\nAINSLEY\n[more firmly] I said don't say that. Say they're smug and superior, say\ntheir approach\nto public policy makes you want to tear your hair out. Say they like high\ntaxes and\nspending your money. Say they want to take your guns and open your borders,\nbut don't\ncall them worthless. At least don't do it in front of me.\n\nBruce and Harriet exchange a look.\n\nAINSLEY\nThe people that I have met have been extraordinarily qualified, their intent\nis good.\nTheir commitment is true, they are righteous, and they are patriots.\n[after a moment, with tears in her eyes] And I'm their lawyer.\n\nShe gets up and walks out.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY\nSATURDAY\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nYou ever read Paul Erlich's book?\n\nTOBY [VO]\n\"The Population Bomb\"?\n\nBARTLET [VO]\nYeah. He wrote it in 1968.

It\nwas falling\nover on itself and it took up too much space. The dwarf wheat... guys,\nit was an\nagricultural revolution that was credited with saving one billion lives.\n\nCharlie approaches and hands Bartlet a small slip of paper. He looks up at\nhim for a\nmoment, then puts on his glasses and takes the message. He unfolds it and\nlooks grave.\n\nTOBY\nIt happened.\n\nBARTLET\nThey executed him in the airport parking lot.\n\nThere is a solemn silence, and Bartlet takes off his glasses and sighs.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.

I sent them home with White House key chains.\n\nThey arrive just outside THE MURAL ROOM, where about 20 or so guests for\nthe radio address\nare waiting.\n\nSAM\nKnock 'em dead.\n\nDONNA\nOh, stay here for a second.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nDONNA\nI'm gonna do my thing.\n\nSAM\nI've seen it.\n\nDONNA\nYeah, but I'm adding a joke.\n\nSAM\nI'm sure it's great.\n\nDONNA\nJust, you know... [gestures toward the Mural Room]\n\nSAM\nSure.\n\nDonna enters. Sam remains standing outside the door.\n\nDONNA\nExcuse me. [clears throat] Good morning.\n\nGUESTS\nGood morning.\n\nDONNA\nWelcome to the White House. My name is Donnatella Moss. I work here in the\nWest Wing as an\nassistant to Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Lyman. Which, I guess, makes me\nDeputy Deputy Chief\nof Staff.\n\nThere is no reaction from the guests. Donna looks over at Sam, who is still\nstanding at the door.\nHe gives her a fake smile and a thumbs up, and quickly turns and walks down\nthe hall.\n\nDONNA\nOkay. Uh, we're gonna go over to the Oval Office now, if you'll follow me.\n\nThe whole group follows Donna into THE OVAL OFFICE, where the recording\ntechnician prepares.\n\nDONNA\nAs you probably know, the President does a regular Saturday morning radio\naddress, which he\nrecords on Friday. The address is usually two to three minutes in length. When\nit's over, the\nPresident will be happy to stand for pictures. Uh, I'm gonna ask you to form\na horseshoe against\nthat wall. Not an actual horseshoe. That takes special training as a\nblacksmith.\n\nAgain, the guests have no reaction to Donna's lame attempt at a joke.\n\nDONNA\nOkay.\n\nBartlet enters.\n\nDONNA\nOh, thank God.\n\nBARTLET\nHow's it going?\n\nDONNA\nThey didn't laugh at the blacksmith joke.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's almost hard to believe, Donna.

Let's do this in one, shall we?\n\nDONNA\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nOne-take Bartlet. That's what old Jack Warner used to call me.\n\nThe guests laugh at Bartlet's joke. The recording technician is ready to\nrecord the radio address.\n\nTECHNICIAN\nHere we go. In three, two...\n\nHe holds up his index finger on 'one', then points to Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\nGood morning. This month, as autumn is in full bloom in much of the nation,\nthe weekends will\nbe devoted by many of you to leaf peeping and football... watch... ing...\n\nHe starts to laugh.\n\nTECHNICIAN\nCut tape.\n\nBARTLET\n[still laughing] I'm sorry. Leaf peeping? Is that something we do now?\n\nTECHNICIAN\nTry another.\n\nDONNA\nWe better get some key chains in here.\n\nBARTLET\nI heard that.\n\nTECHNICIAN\nHere we go.

In the mean time...\n\nC.J.\nI'm going to tell you something, Toby: I don't think it's that she's a\nRepublican, I think it's\nthat she's a Republican woman and she's good-looking.\n\nTOBY\nWell, those are three things, when in combination, usually spell 'careerism,'\nbut...\n\nC.J.\nWell, I think it's sexist in a bad way, and I'm coming down on her side.\n\nTOBY\nGood for you.

He's\na brilliant and\nfair-minded attorney, and he will accept you on his staff because he\nis... well, fair-minded\nand because...\n\nAINSLEY\nYou haven't told him yet!\n\nLEO\n[turning to her, smiling] I have, in fact, not told him yet, no.\n\nAINSLEY\nSo you lied to me just then.\n\nLEO\nI'm a politician, Ainsley. Of course I lied to you just then.\n\nAINSLEY\nMy first day is getting off to a great start.\n\nLEO\nIt's about to get better.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhy?\n\nMARGARET\n[walks in] Leo?\n\nLEO\nYeah?\n\nMARGARET\nLionel Tribbey is on his way over.

She clerked for Dreifort.\n\nTRIBBEY\nWell, Dreifort's an idiot.\n\nLEO\nDreifort's a Supreme Court Justice, Lionel, so let's speak of him with\nrespect and practice some\ntolerance for those who disagree with us.\n\nTRIBBEY\nI believe, as long as Justice Dreifort is intolerant toward gays, lesbians,\nblacks, unions,\nwomen, poor people, and first, fourth, fifth, and ninth amendments, I will\nremain intolerant\ntoward him. [grins at Ainsley] Nice to meet you. [walks outside the office]\n\nLEO\nShe's working for you, Lionel!\n\nTribbey returns immediately.\n\nTRIBBEY\nExcuse me?\n\nLEO\nShe's working for you.

He calms down a bit.\n\nTRIBBEY\nYes. Well. [swings the bat on his shoulder again] Good morning, everyone! Thank\nyou, Mr. President.\n[walks out of the room in complete silence]\n\nBARTLET\nWell, obviously, Lionel Tribbey is a brilliant lawyer whom we cannot live\nwithout, or there\nwould be very little reason not to put him in prison.

Ainsely quickly stands up.\n\nAINSLEY\nMr. Tribbey.\n\nTRIBBEY\nI see they've found you an office.\n\nAINSLEY\nSuch as it is.\n\nTRIBBEY\nGood men and women have worked in whatever room was available in this building,\nand have done\nso without complaint.\n\nAINSLEY\nI don't believe you heard me complain, Mr. Tribbey.\n\nTRIBBEY\nI believe I did, Miss Hayes. Now, why don't you tell me what this is all\nabout?\n\nAINSLEY\nSir?\n\nTRIBBEY\nThese people here are trying to do something. I'll have their backs while\nthey're trying.\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nAINSLEY\nServing my country.\n\nTRIBBEY\nWhy not join the Navy?\n\nAINSLEY\nI was asked to do this.\n\nTRIBBEY\nAnd you said yes.\n\nAINSLEY\nYes.\n\nTRIBBEY\nWhy?\n\nAINSLEY\nI feel a sense of duty. [almost stops her sentence]\n\nTRIBBEY\nI'm sorry?\n\nAINSLEY\nI said I feel a sense of duty.\n\nTRIBBEY\nWhat, did you just walk out of The Pirates of Penzance?\n\nAINSLEY\nSir?\n\nTRIBBEY\n[in a bad accent] \"Why, he's an Englishman.\"\n\nAINSLEY\n\"He is an Englishman\" is from H.M.S.

And it's from Pinafore.\n\nTRIBBEY\nMiss Hayes...\n\nAINSLEY\nIs it so hard to believe, in this day and age, that someone would roll up\ntheir sleeves, set\naside partisanship, and say, \"What can I do?\"\n\nTRIBBEY\n[smirks] Yes.\n\nThere are several seconds of mutual reactions.\n\nTRIBBEY\nI want you to go up to the Hill this afternoon and I want you to talk to\nthe Associate Majority\nCounsel at Government Affairs.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou're sending me to the Associate Counsel 'cause I speak Republican.\n\nTRIBBEY\nYes.

Any advice you could give\nme that might point\nme the way of success would be, by me, appreciated.\n\nTRIBBEY\n[pause] Well, not speaking in iambic pentameter might be a step in the right\ndirection.\n\nAINSLEY\nYeah.\n\nHe turns to leave again.\n\nAINSLEY\nThe President's way too moderate for your taste.\n\nTRIBBEY\n[turns back] Excuse me?\n\nAINSLEY\nOn affirmative action, capital gains, public schools, free trade...

A map and the President's\nitinerary, given to\nthe shooters by the chapter head of White Pride. A videotape of a meeting\nthe shooters attended\nwith the leader railing against interracial couples, specifically citing\nCharlie and Zoey, using\nthe term \"lone wolf\" over and over, which is the phrase they use when they\nwant their younger\nmembers to take matters into their own hands. A copy of Hunter, by William\nPierce, bought at a\nKlan rally in Blacksburg. In the book, Pierce encourages fellow supremacists\nto rid the earth of\ninterracial couples by shooting them. This is enough -- more than enough --\nto begin deposing\nwitnesses.\n\nSam and Josh reach LEO'S OFFICE. Leo and Toby are inside.\n\nSAM\n[to Leo] You wanted to see me?\n\nLEO\nUh, yeah. I just wanted to tell you that Joyce and Brookline are at it again.\n\nSAM\nWhat'd they do?\n\nLEO\nThey told Government Affairs that we never had the Rockland memo.\n\nJOSH\nI think we did have the Rockland memo.\n\nLEO\nWe did. Would you talk to the two of them?\n\nSAM\nYeah... I think I also better talk to someone on Government Affairs.\n\nLEO\nTribbey already sent Ainsley Hayes.\n\nSAM\nTo do what?\n\nLEO\nTalk to the Associate Majority...\n\nSAM\nThat's something I couldn't do?\n\nLEO\nHe wanted to send a lawyer.\n\nSAM\nI'm a lawyer.

And I'll tell everybody else to keep their fingers crossed a story\nhasn't been leaked we\nwithheld evidence then tried to cover our tracks.\n\nTOBY\nSam, that's enough.\n\nSAM\n[sighs] Anything else?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nSAM\nThank you. [exits]\n\nTOBY\nHis point isn't wholly without merit, Leo.\n\nLEO\n[turns to Josh] What do you need?\n\nJOSH\nSam was talking to me. The Southern Poverty Law Center...\n\nTOBY\nWe know.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do you think?\n\nTOBY\nWell, I'm not wild about it.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\nOur people can be deposed too, which leaves them vulnerable to embarrassing\nquestions like,\n\"Have you ever tried cocaine?\" They can ask Sam has he ever slept with a\nprostitute?\n\nJOSH\nThose questions are irrelevant.\n\nLEO\nThat's why they'll ask them. If one of our people refuses to answer, it's\na story.\n\nTOBY\nSo we're not wild about it.\n\nLEO\nThat said, say the word, and we'll take a leave of absence and join your\nlegal team.\n\nJosh exits. Toby stands to leave.\n\nTOBY\n\"He is an Englishman\" is from Pinafore.

Watching are Donna and Charlie.\n\nDONNA\nI have a really good feeling about this one, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIs this still my first term?\n\nDONNA\nYes sir, but I do take your point: we've spent quite a bit of time on this.\n\nBARTLET\nHere we go.\n\nTECHNICIAN\nIn five, four, three, two...\n\nBARTLET\nGood evening.\n\nCHARLIE\nCut.\n\nBARTLET and DONNA\nWhat?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's morning.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's evening. It's dark outside, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's evening now, Mr. President. It's morning tomorrow.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat time is it?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's 5:45 sir.\n\nBartlet gets frantic.\n\nDONNA\nHere we go.\n\nTECHNICIAN\nIn five...\n\nBARTLET\nExcuse me... No. I can't. I've got to go.\n\nDONNA\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nKids, I am so sorry. I have to go now, to a special meeting... of the\ngovernment. I will mail\nyou all an autographed copy of the picture we took together. And one day,\nyou will all understand.\n\nBartlet quickly exits to the PORTICO. Charlie and Donna follow as Bartlet\nwalks out the door.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nTake a break, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nShe's not there, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm going to a special meeting...\n\nCHARLIE\n...of the government. Yes, sir. She had to go to Pennsylvania early.\n\nBartlet turns around.\n\nCHARLIE\nWould you like to come back inside and take another swing at the radio\naddress?\n\nBARTLET\nSure. Would you like to get that smile off your face before I send you on\nspecial assignment\nto the Yukon?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nThe three reenter THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nGENERAL ED BARRIE barges in C.J.'s office past Carol. C.J., who was behind\nher desk, quickly\nstands.\n\nCAROL [VO]\nGeneral, I'm sorry, she's--\n\nGENERAL ED BARRIE\nI've ordered many men on assignment, Ms. Cregg. I've sent them to Hue City,\nKhe Sahn village,\nDanang...\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARRIE\nDon't interrupt me, lady. I've sent them to Grenada, I've sent them to Haiti,\nand I've sent them\nto Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. All acts of cowardice?\n\nC.J. has circled him and closed the door.\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARRIE\nYou think sending my aide here was an act of cowardice? You think I have\nthe time and\ninclination...\n\nC.J.\nSir, due respect, that wasn't what I was referring to. I think jumping up\nand down on the\nCommander in Chief and then beating a path out of town is an act of cowardice.\n\nBARRIE\nI think alerting the public to staggeringly dangerous vulnerabilities of\nthe current state of\nthe military is an act of conscience.\n\nC.J.\nAnd I would too, sir, except -- and again, I say this with all due respect...\n\nBARRIE\nShove your respect! I don't want it!\n\nC.J.\nI say this with all due respect: I think your motives are personal, and I'd\nlike to discuss\nthat, sir.\n\nBARRIE\nSure! How about we discuss new defense spending being down to three hundred\nbillion from four\nhundred billion ten years ago. Is that personal?\n\nC.J.\nNo, sir, I think that's about the cold war ending ten years ago and America\nnot needing to spend\nquite so much money defending itself against a country that can't bake bread.\n\nBARRIE\nKitten... Op-Tempo is up, which is fine, but the problem is Pers-Tempo is\nup too. Do you know what\nthat is? It's the rate of turnover in individual jobs.\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir. Pers-Tempo is up because higher paying civilian jobs are luring\nmen and women trained\nin high tech. We're more than happy to take the rap for a booming economy,\nsir.\n\nBARRIE\nTwo divisions, the 10th Mountain Division at Ft. Drum and the 1st Infantry\nin Germany, have been\nrated C4. That's the lowest of four possible readiness grades. It means,\n\"Unfit for service.\"\n\nC.J.\nNo sir. Again, with all respect, I hate to disagree, but it means unfit for\nservice based on the\nPentagon's \"two war\" doctrine. It's based on how fast these divisions would\nbe able to extract\nthemselves from their peacekeeping mission, retrain on home bases, and ship\noff to a second of\ntwo, full-scale Gulf-War-sized conflicts. There are also some both inside\nand outside the\nPentagon who question whether the C4 ratings might not be a political maneuver\non the part of\nthe DOD to help Republican allies in Congress secure more defense money.\n\nBARRIE\nWell, I'll be telling my story to Tim Russert. [turns to the door]\n\nC.J.\nNo, I don't think you will, General.\n\nBARRIE\n[turns back] I'm sorry?\n\nC.J.\nI said, \"I don't think you will.\" [beat] I notice among your many decorations\nis the Distinguished\nCombat Service Medal. You're wearing it now, as well as in numerous\nphotographs, including some\ntaken with enlisted men in the field. You won it while on temporary duty\nwith the Navy's U.S.S.\nBrooke. [beat] The thing is, the Brooke was never fired on, and it never\nshot its guns. Right now,\nand in photographs, you're wearing a medal you never won. How does that\nusually go over with the\nboys? [long pause]\n\nBARRIE\nHe never served in uniform, not once... and he presumes...\n\nC.J.\nIs there anything else, sir?\n\nGeneral Barrie leaves C.J. standing in her office.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT.

I'm Ainsley Hayes.\n\nMARK BROOKLINE\nMark Brookline.\n\nSTEVE JOYCE\nSteve Joyce.\n\nAINSLEY\nIs there some place a little more private we can speak?\n\nJOYCE\nWhat do you think, the Oval Office?\n\nBROOKLINE\nOval Office works. Or the Cabinet room.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhy don't we just step out into the hall?\n\nAinsley leaves. The men follow her to the HALLWAY.\n\nAINSLEY\n[clears throat] Okay, we'll keep our voices down.\n\nBROOKLINE\n[mocking whisper] O-kay.\n\nAINSLEY\nLionel Tribbey asked me to take care of the false testimony you gave to the\nGovernmental Affairs\nCommittee.\n\nBROOKLINE\nFalse testimony?\n\nAINSLEY\nRegarding the Rockland memo.\n\nBROOKLINE\nLook at your watch, Steve, 17 seconds it took her to call us liars.\n\nAINSLEY\nFellas... that's not what I was saying. I chose the wrong word and I\napologize. Mistaken\ntestimony, you're absolutely right. Anyway, I spoke to the Associate Counsel,\nand I think we're\ngoing to be fine. Two things I wanted to mention--\n\nJOYCE\nMark--I'm sorry, I have work to do.\n\nBROOKLINE\nYeah.\n\nAINSLEY\nNo, this'll just take a second. First of all, forgive me if I'm repeating\nsomebody else, but I'd\nbe remiss if I didn't make sure you understood that section 194 of the\nfederal code says Congress\ncan turn your testimony over to a US attorney and he'd most likely empanel\na grand jury. You don't\nwant any part of that.\n\nBROOKLINE\nThanks. You know, we both went to high school.\n\nAINSLEY\nYeah, um, the second thing is this: your attitude during your testimony is\nbeing taken by some of\nthe Republican committee members as a sign of disrespect.\n\nJOYCE\nOh, please--\n\nAINSLEY\nNo, hang on a second. This is so easy to fix we are gonna pick up\nyardage. Write a short note,\nhave it delivered by messenger to the majority counsel, and copy the chairman\nand the Speaker.\n\nJOYCE\nYour first act on the job is asking us to apologize to the Republicans on\nthe Governmental\nAffairs Committee--\n\nBROOKLINE\nAnd the Speaker of the House, Steve.\n\nJOYCE\n--because they didn't like our attitude?\n\nAINSLEY\nYeah, I know this doesn't look good. But the fact is, it's the smart thing\nto do, and if you\ndon't do it at my suggestion, I know Lionel Tribbey is going to come down\nhere and you're gonna\nhave to do it at his.\n\nJOYCE\nI have work to do.\n\nBROOKLINE\nYeah.\n\nThey go into their office and close the door, leaving Ainsley in the hall.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - NIGHT\nJust outside the President's bedroom, two Secret Service agents stand by\nthe door.

Where I am gonna change into a special\nlittle garment I think\nyou might enjoy!\n\nBARTLET\nAbbey, you have two minutes, or I swear to God I'm gonna get Mrs. Landingham\ndrunk.\n\nABBEY\nLoosen your tie. Loosen whatever you'd like.\n\nAbbey goes to the bathroom, as Bartlet goes to fix drinks, loosening his\ntie on the way.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat was that thing you were doin'?\n\nABBEY [OS]\nWhen?\n\nBARTLET\nTonight, in Pennsylvania.\n\nABBEY [OS]\nYou know what it was.\n\nBARTLET\nIt was a monument dedication, a statue?\n\nABBEY [OS]\nYeah!\n\nBARTLET\nStatue to who?\n\nABBEY [OS]\nNellie Bly.\n\nBARTLET\nYou went all the way to Cochran's... whatever to dedicate a monument to\nNellie Bly? Abbey, you\ncan really pass that kind of thing along.\n\nAbbey reappears, behind him, her shoes being the only thing she took off.\n\nBARTLET [cont.]\nYou don't have to accept every invitation from every yahoo historical society\nthat knows someone\nin the Social Office. If you want, I can have Charlie--\n\nHe turns around, drinks in hand.\n\nBARTLET\nYou haven't changed into the \"special garment\".\n\nABBEY\nCochran's Mills is where I went.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. You know what I did, just then, that was stupid? [laughs] I minimized\nthe importance of the\nstatue that was dedicated to Nellie Bly, an extraordinary woman to whom we\nall owe a great deal.\n\nABBEY\nYou don't know who she is, do you?\n\nBARTLET\nThis isn't happening to me.\n\nABBEY\nShe pioneered investigative journalism.\n\nBARTLET\nThen she's the one I want to beat the crap out of.\n\nABBEY\nShe risked her life by having herself committed to a mental institution for\nten days so she could\nwrite about it. She changed entirely the way we treat the mentally ill in\nthis country.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, Abigail--\n\nShe takes a glass from him.\n\nABBEY\nIn 1890, she traveled around the world in 72 days, 6 hours, 11 minutes and\n14 seconds, besting,\nby more than one week, Jules Verne's 80 days.\n\nBARTLET\nShe sounds like an incredible woman, Abbey. I'm particularly impressed that\nshe beat a fictional\nrecord. If she goes twenty-one thousand leagues under the sea I'll name a\ndamn school after her.\nLet's have sex.\n\nABBEY\nWhen it comes to historical figures being memorialized in this country,\nwomen have been largely\noverlooked. Nellie Bly is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBARTLET\nI couldn't possibly hear about the rest of the iceberg right now.\n\nABBEY\nElizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to be awarded an M.D. She\nfounded the Women's\nMedical College.\n\nBARTLET\nKeep talking.

Tomorrow is Saturday.\nI will be here. You can call me and be rude by phone or you can stop by and\ndo it in person.\n'Cause I think if I have to endure another disappointment today from this\nplace that I have\nworshipped, I am gonna lose it.

PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY\n\nREPORTER\nIs he meeting with Nancy McNally?\n\nC.J.\nNo, I want to make it very clear that Mr. Konanov, while he's here in\nWashington is not\nmeeting with the Secretary of State or any Cabinet level official for that\nmatter.\nHe's not meeting with the UN ambassador or any senior aides representing\nNATO allies.\nAnd he's certainly not meeting with the President. He will be coming to the\nWhite House\nto meet with some of the President's advisors on the Balkans. Who's next?\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.? C.J.!\n\nREPORTER 1\nC.J., Senator elect Morgan Mitchell's going to announce on Hardball later\ntoday that\nhe'll seek a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Then he'll block a\nvote on the\nTest Ban Treaty to prevent it coming to the floor.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nREPORTER 1\nAny thoughts?\n\nC.J.\nWe'll have a fully ratified, comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\nREPORTER 2\nMitchell says over his dead body.\n\nC.J.\nI think like all freshmen, Senator elect Mitchell will discover that he is\none of\na hundred and that his power is considerably less than he would like it to\nbe.\nThat having been said, the new Senate will ratify the Treaty and we really\ndon't\ncare what condition his body is in when we do.\n\nClamoring for C.J.\n\nC.J.\nDanny.\n\nDANNY\nHas the President considered ordering a lame duck session so the current\nSenate can\nvote on the Treaty?\n\nC.J.\nOkay, anyone but Danny?\n\nDANNY\nC.J.?!\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nDANNY\nHe hasn't considered it?\n\nC.J.\nDanny, I don't know every thought that passes through the President's head,\nbut there\nhave been no discussions.\n\nDANNY\nThat you're aware of?\n\nC.J.\nThat I'm aware of.\n\nDANNY\nWell, I'd like to know if the President's considered it. Is that something\nyou could\ncheck out and get back to us on?\n\nC.J.\nYou bet. Who's next?\n\nMore clamoring.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\nJosh is watching in his office with Donna.\n\nJOSH\n[collecting files] She walked into it. She knows it too.\n\nDONNA\nWalked into what?\n\nJOSH\nShe can't confirm that the President hasn't considered it less she asks the\nPresident\nif he's considered it, at which point, he'll have considered it.\n\nDONNA\nThat sounds pretty stupid.\n\nJOSH\nIt was a better organized thought in my head. Is she done?\n\nDONNA\nShe's wrapping up.\n\nJOSH\nLet's go.\n\nThey leave Josh's office and start walking down the HALLWAY.\n\nDONNA\nHas he considered it?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nDONNA\nWhy not?\n\nJOSH\nWhy should he?\n\nDONNA\nIf he thinks he has a better chance of ratifying the Test Ban Treaty with\nthis Congress\nthan the new one.\n\nJOSH\nHe doesn't.\n\nDONNA\nBut if Morgan Mitchell says...\n\nJOSH\nMitchell's not a factor.\n\nDONNA\nJosh, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nDONNA\nOSHA.\n\nJOSH\nHow do you change subjects so fast?\n\nDONNA\nJosh, I...\n\nJOSH\nNo, I mean it. How do you go from a Test Ban Treaty and a Lame Duck Congress\nto OSHA?\n\nDONNA\nBecause I'm me. Do you know how many people acquire Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?\n\nJOSH\nIt shouldn't surprise you to learn that I do not.\n\nDONNA\n600,000 Americans a year. Do you have any idea how painful it is?\n\nJOSH\nDonna, in the scheme of things, who really cares?\n\nDonna grabs Josh's ear and pulls it back, hard.\n\nDONNA\nDo you have any idea how painful it is?\n\nJOSH\nYes, yes, yes, yes.\n\nDonna lets him go.\n\nDONNA\nPain in the forearm, no grip, you lose the ability to pinch.\n\nJOSH\nPeople who lose the ability to pinch, I got to tell you, I don't know from\nwhere\nthey summon the will to go on.\n\nDONNA\nYou guys are on the wrong side of this.\n\nJOSH\nAren't you one of 'you guys'?\n\nDONNA\nNot on this.\n\nDonna goes off. Josh meets up with C.J. They keep walking.\n\nJOSH\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nI know!\n\nJOSH\nYou walked right into it.\n\nC.J.\nThere was no other direction to walk. Now, please, just answer know to this\nquestion:\nHas the President considered it?\n\nThey reach the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nC.J.\nGood.\n\nJOSH\nListen, not that I know of.\n\nC.J.\nJosh!\n\nSam arrives behind them.\n\nSAM\nListen.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nHe should consider it, he should consider it right now.\n\nC.J.\nMitchell isn't going to get a seat on Foreign Relations.\n\nSAM\nThere's a seat open on Appropriations.\n\nJOSH\nCasey'll move?\n\nSAM\nWhat do you think?\n\nToby comes out of his office.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's going on?\n\nJOSH\nCasey wants appropriations. And he has the seniority.\n\nSAM\nSo he'll have to give up budget.\n\nJOSH\nWhich Taglio will jump at in a second. Which clears the way for Newberry in\nSenate\nArmed Services.\n\nC.J.\nNewberry leaving opens up Judiciary.\n\nSAM\nNow, who wants to be Attorney-General under the next Republican President?\n\nJOSH\nHoward Weston.\n\nSAM\nThat's right. So he takes the seat on Judiciary.\n\nJOSH\nVacating his seat on Foreign Relations.\n\nC.J.\nSo? There's a seat open on Foreign Relations, that doesn't mean Mitchell's\ngoing to get it.\n\nSAM\nYes it does.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nNobody else's going to want it.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\nBecause there's no money in it. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no\ncontrol over\nbudget so there are no lobbyists, which means there are no fundraisers.\n\nC.J.\nThe Constitution says 'under extraordinary circumstances'.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a Treaty that's vital to national and global security. What kind of\nextraordinary\ncircumstances do you have in mind?\n\nC.J.\nThese people-\n\nJOSH\nSam, you've been studying this, do you think we have any chance with the\nnew Congress?\n\nSAM\nI think we have no chance with the new Congress.\n\nC.J. isn't happy about this.\n\nSAM\nWhile I've never lived through a massive nuclear explosion, decimating all\nforms of life\nin a two hundred mile radius, I've seen pictures. And I couldn't agree with\nJosh more\nin his interpretation of the 'extraordinary circumstances' clause of the\nconstitution.\n\nTOBY\nIs Leo free now?\n\nJOSH\n[looking at clock] Five minutes.\n\nC.J.\nThese people are gone. The 106th Congress is adjourned, twelve of them were\nvoted out\nof office. This is bad pool. You go in there now and tell the President to\ncall a lame\nduck session and he does, it's going to look like politics.\n\nTOBY\nIt is politics.\n\nHe turns back to his office.\n\nC.J.\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nLet's see Leo.\n\nC.J.\nWhat are you going to tell the 12 people who are out there looking for new\njobs?\n\nTOBY\nThey may not be done with their old ones yet.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\n\n\t10:15 A.M.\n\nSam, Josh and C.J. are on the couches explaining their plan to Leo and the\nPresident.\n\nSAM\nCasey's gonna want Appropriations.\n\nJOSH\nHe wants budget.\n\nSAM\nHe's on Budget.\n\nJOSH\nThat's right.\n\nSAM\nHe's gonna want Appropriations.\n\nJOSH\nCasey's gonna want Appropriations.\n\nSAM\nAnd he has the seniority.\n\nJOSH\nThat means he's going to have to give up the Budget place.\n\nC.J.\nTaglio'll take that.\n\nSAM\nWhich clears the way for Newberry in armed services.\n\nJOSH\nNewberry'll take his seat on Judiciary.\n\nC.J.\nWhich means Weston leaves foreign relations.\n\nSAM\nWhich is where Mitchell comes in.\n\nToby joins the meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nLEO\nGuys!\n\nBARTLET\nIt's like trying to run the country with Barnum Bailey and his sister Sue.\n\nSam, C.J. and Josh all start talking at once.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, will it be possible for just two of them to speak at once?\n\nLEO\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nThere was an hour and ten minute meeting with Dick Rush, Ed, Marty Beech\nand Henry\nRodriguez. I've never seen both political and legislative liaisons so\nunanimous in\na diagnosis.\n\nLEO\nThey think you should call it.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President, we have better chance of winning now than a month from now.\n\nSAM\nNot only that but...\n\nLEO\nSam!\n\nSAM\nSorry.\n\nLEO\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nNot only that but here's what C.J. can tell the press. The world is looking\nto the U.S.\nto ratify the Treaty first. The longer we wait, the longer it takes other\ncountries to\nratify. The closer we get to unstable countries like Pakistan developing a\nnuclear threat.\n\nLEO\nArguments against?\n\nSAM\nWe might lose the vote. That'll hang around our necks for two years.\n\nJOSH\nThe Senate'll be pissed off, they might stall confirmations.\n\nC.J.\nAnd I can just add that a Senator Elect announcing what committee assignment\nhe'd like\nit not...\n\nTOBY\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nIt's not what the founders would have considered an extraordinary occasion.\n\nSAM\nHa. An extraordinary occasion is whatever the President says it is.\n\nJOSH\nAn extraordinary occasion...\n\nC.J., Sam and Josh argue.\n\nBARTLET\n[calling] Charlie!\n\nCHARLIE\n[opening the door] Yes sir?\n\nBARTLET\nCould I have a couple of aspirin and a weapon of some kind to kill people\nwith?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nLook, even when they're here in session, trying to get a hundred Senators\nin line is\nstill like getting cats to march in parade.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do you want to do?\n\nLEO\nLet's get the leaderships temperature on a lame duck session. And let's also\nget some\nkind of nose count and see where we are.\n\nTOBY\nC.J., leak that the President's considering calling the Senate back.\n\nC.J.\nThat actually, is not going to be a problem.\n\nLEO\nThe source is big enough that they go with it, small enough that we're not\ntied to it.\nToby, get me a nose count.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nBartlet stands up, everyone else does too.\n\nLEO\nWhat else?\n\nJOSH\nThe State Department wants permission to change the terminology from Rogue\nNations to\nState of Concern.\n\nLEO\nNot now. What else?\n\nTOBY\nMedicare coverage of clinical trials.\n\nLEO\nNot now. What else?\n\nSAM\nFraud awareness for small business owners.\n\nLEO\nNot now. Anything else?\n\nNo response.\n\nLEO\nThe four of you wait in my office.\n\nThey file out with various, 'Thank you sir's.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you all.\n\nBartlet stands behind his desk. Leo leans on the front of it.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen does Konanov get here?\n\nLEO\nIn a few minutes.\n\nBARTLET\nNo high level meetings, right?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nLEO\nYou don't want to call this vote, then lose.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, but this could be window.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWe've got see if it's doable.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nIt could be doable.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nYou got anything more to say?\n\nLEO\nNot this minute.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nLeo walks into his office and stands behind his desk looking at the Senior\nStaff.\n\nLEO\nThere'll be an editorial in The Post tomorrow.\n\nC.J.\nYou're kidding me?\n\nLEO\n'The President's time isn't being used efficiently.'\n\nC.J.\nIt couldn't wait?\n\nLEO\n'Schedules are abandoned before lunchtime.'\n\nC.J.\nThat's four in two weeks.\n\nLEO\n'The West Wing resembles a high school year-book office.' And I believe I\nam compared\nto a substitute teacher.\n\nSAM\nThat's ridiculous.\n\nLEO\nNo, it's not.\n\nC.J.\nLeo...\n\nLEO\nCertainly not based on the display I just saw in there. So, new rules. You\nneed an answer\nfrom the President, you need to brief him on something, you want him the\nway in; I want\nto see a summary on my desk. Absolutely no longer than two pages. And I want\nmy initials\non it before you go into the Oval Office.\n\nSAM\nLeo.\n\nJOSH\nA two page summary's gonna kind of cramp our style.\n\nLEO\nYour style could use a little cramping. Are we understood?\n\nALL\nYes.\n\nLEO\nToby, Sam, take some meetings on the Hill tonight. Toby, concentrate on\nvotes that can be\nlost with Stensen gone. Sam, dangle reservations in front of them. C.J. start\nthe leak.\n\nSam, C.J. and Toby start to leave.\n\nLEO\nOh, anybody happens to see Vasily Konanov in the hallways, walk in the other\ndirection.\n\nC.J. stays, the others leave.\n\nSAM\nI can't unleash my full potential in a two page summary.\n\nTOBY\nListen to me.\n\nSam, Toby and Josh leave Leo's office and walk in the HALLWAY. They will\nend up in\nSAM'S OFFICE.\n\nTOBY\nListen to me. I'm going to meet with Fox and Fowler. Sam, you're gonna go\nto the Hill.\n\nSAM\nDo you think with Stensen gone...?\n\nTOBY\nI think with Stensen gone I can get Fox and Fowler to loosen up some votes,\nThat is if\nI can ever get them to order lunch off of the damn menu.\n\nJOSH\nThey don't order?\n\nTOBY\nYou've never seen grown men order lunch like this. Fox and Fowler'll loosen\nvotes.\nSam, you're up on the Hill dropping we'll consider reservations. It is not\nout of\nthe realm of possibility that that meeting gets us eight votes.\n\nJOSH\nTheir bosses want to talk to the President? He's right by the phone.\n\nTOBY\nSo this is not an unimportant meeting.\n\nSAM\nJust so you know, I also have to take a 22 page position paper and summarize\nit in\ntwo pages. It's gotta be done some time today.\n\nJOSH\nYou can staff that, give it to Ainsley Hayes.\n\nSAM\nI can't give it to Ainsley. She's...\n\nTOBY\nGet over it.\n\nSAM\nOkay, but there are going to be nine different jokes because I asked her\nfor help.\n\nTOBY\n'Reservations' that's the word you're dropping when you're on the Hill. You're\nnot to\nleave the meeting in the wind. Just say the word.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nThey all start to leave for their offices.\n\nTOBY\nOh.\n\nThey turn back.\n\nTOBY\nLet's be able to end this day by telling the President that he's in striking\ndistance\nand he should seriously consider the session. Let's be able to do\nthat. [looking around]\nWhere's C.J.?\n\nJOSH\nLooking for a reporter to leak the story to.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nC.J. meets Danny in the yellow hallway.

You're going to have to find\nsomebody\nelse who, you know, cares.\n\nDONNA\nYou don't have to be in charge of it, OSHA is. They're come up with a new\nseries of\nindustry standards. And I want to know why the White House isn't implementing\nthem.\n\nJOSH\n[pouring himself coffee] Because the SPA says the cost to small business\ncould exceed 18\nbillion dollars in the first year. They'll be a huge increase in workmen's\ncompensation\npremiums. And republicans find the word ergonomics to be silly.\n\nDONNA\nIf we backed off everything because of words Republicans find silly we'd\nhave a lot of\npregnant teenagers and no health care.\n\nJOSH\nWe do have a lot of pregnant teenagers and no health care.\n\nDONNA\nSo, how's your plan going so far?\n\nThey are back at JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nJOSH\nLook...\n\nCharlie appears at the door.\n\nCHARLIE\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\nHang on Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, I don't think it's going to wait.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nCHARLIE\nVasily Konanov is here.\n\nJOSH\nI can't see him.

I say fine,\nit's a\nsymbolic gesture with no real consequence. It gains us points with allies\nwho feel\nwe've been too harsh and it signals to the seven countries we're talking\nabout that\nwe are open to taking positive steps in the future if they initiate reforms.\n\nLEO\nAny down side?\n\nC.J.\nI'll feel stupid.\n\nLEO\nI can live with that.\n\nC.J.\nYou certainly have so far.\n\nLEO\nWell. Hey, make sure you talk to the President by the end of the day.\n\nC.J.\nSure, about what?\n\nLEO\nDanny Concannon wants access for a three part feature about...\n\nC.J.\nNo!\n\nLEO\nNo what?\n\nC.J.\nNo he can't have access.\n\nLEO\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nHe can't have access. Leo, his editorial staff just jumped up and down on\nyour head\nyesterday, and last Thursday and the President twice before that. Four times\nin two\nweeks!

He lost his\nseat.\n\nTOBY\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nThe man's done it.\n\nTOBY\nObviously he hasn't.\n\nA beat.\n\nLEO\nI set up this meeting. And what's your pitch?\n\nTOBY\nThat this treaty want's bad. It can happen. Not only that but he can stick\nit to\nevery Pennsylvanian voters who put him out of a job and take Mitchell's\nknees out\nbefore he has a chance to put his pencils in a jar. Plus, who'd we lose?\n\nLEO\nI don't know who we lost?\n\nTOBY\nHe'll know.\n\nLEO\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nLeo.\n\nLEO\nHe's been out of town for a month and a half.\n\nTOBY\nHe'll know!

Today, tomorrow, next year, next term, these guys'll\nhave the\ntreaty ratified and they'll do it without the reservations he just offered\nto discuss\nwith you.\n\nThey all get up to leave.\n\nAINSLEY\n[beat] Can I take this muffin?\n\nKEENE\nYeah?!\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Screw it! If we're going to have a\nfighting\nchance, we've got to invite Marino. Marino's going to want in because...\n\nLEO\nMarino's a street kid who lives for revenge.\n\nJOSH\nI was going to say 'because Marino's devoted to the issue'.\n\nLEO\nAlso, we may have lost one of our guys.\n\nJOSH\nWho?\n\nLEO\nToby's going to ask Marino.\n\nJosh sees Donna walking down the hallway.\n\nJOSH\n[calling] Hey, Norma Rae!

You have no value to Eastern Europe.\n\nDONNA\nOkay. You know what this is?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nDONNA\nThis is an opportunity.\n\nJOSH\nThat's right.\n\nDONNA\nThis is an audience with a man who understands the plight of the worker.\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nDONNA\n[worried] Or did you think that because he's a reformer, he'll understand the\nplight of economics.\n\nJOSH\nWell, he's drunk, and he doesn't speak a lot of English so I don't think\nhe'll\nunderstand much of anything at all.

And I'm going to choose not to assume that\nmy constituents\nfeel a certain way because they were duped.\n\nTOBY\nSenator, nobody expects... you know... you're not expected to...\n\nMARINO\nNobody expects, nobody expects. Toby it seems to me that more and more we've\ncome to\nexpect less and less from each other. And I think that should change.

THE WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n\t8:25 P.M.\n\nBonnie is leading a tour group through the White House.\n\nBONNIE\nNow, this is the North-West executive entrance to the White House. Now,\nordinarily I'd\nbe allowed to show you more but the President's in the West Wing right now\nand when he's\nin his office we like to the area as quiet as possible.\n\nToby comes in complaining.\n\nTOBY\nThe whole damn world's flying apart at the equator, did you know that, Bonnie?\n\nBONNIE\n[gesturing to Toby] This, of course, is my boss, Toby Ziegler.\n\nToby stops and addresses the group.\n\nTOBY\nWhy's the Test Ban Treaty so important? Well! Let me tell you. In 1974 India\nset off\na peaceful nuclear explosion. Indira Ghandi herself said they had no intention\nof\nbuilding a bomb, they just wanted to know that they could. 20 years later\nIndia set\noff five nuclear explosions. Who gets nervous? Pakistan.

SAM'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nAinsley and Sam are in his office. Ainsley is pacing.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam, half of America's workforce is employed by small business. That's\ncompanies\nthat employ fewer than 100 workers.\n\nSAM\nI know what a small business is.\n\nAINSLEY\nThen you know that a third of them fail. One third of all small businesses\nlose\nmoney and fail. Not because of rent hikes, or big businesses squeezing them\nout,\nbut because of why?\n\nSAM\nEmployee fraud.\n\nAINSLEY\nThat's right.\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhy do you say that?\n\nSAM\nYou reversed my position.\n\nAINSLEY\nOther than that, Sam, other than what you've been saying for the last hour\nand a half.\n\nSAM\nI can't believe I'm listening to a Republican tell me the government should\nrun\nbackground checks into peak business. In fact I can't believe I'm listening\nto a\nRepublican. Could it possibly be that most of the people you want to\nfingerprint\nhave darker skin than you do?\n\nAINSLEY\nWell, not to let the facts interfere with a good story, but 80% of violators\nare white.\nFraudulent employees are three times more likely to be married, they're four\ntimes more\nlikely to be to be men, 16 times more likely to be managers and executives\nand guess\nwhat, professor, they're five times more likely to have post graduate degrees.\n\nSAM\nYou, listen. I, you know, I can't. Alright. Start from the beginning.\n\nAINSLEY\nReally?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nAINSLEY\nAre you eating that doughnut?\n\nSAM\nTake the doughnut.

Charlie, I'm here to see the President.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, he's finishing up a meeting.\n\nC.J.\nCharlie, Danny's paper, after savaging us four times in two weeks would like\naccess\nso Danny can write a three part feature.\n\nCHARLIE\nAbout what?\n\nC.J.\nAbout winning a Pulitzer Prize for writing a three part feature.\n\nDANNY\nLook!\n\nC.J.\nSee reporters seldom win a Pulitzer, feature writers do. And the Post has\nbeen getting\na little out paced in the hardware department lately.\n\nDANNY\nCharlie, you know I'm here, do you suspect my motives are anything but\njournalistic?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, I'd definitely like to be part of this conversation.\n\nDANNY\n[to C.J.] Are you telling me this doesn't have anything to do with...?\n\nCHARLIE\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nThank you.\n\nC.J. walks into THE OVAL OFFICE as much as away from Danny.

But the first, third and fourth were silly. And\nthe fourth\nwas mean spirited.\n\nC.J.\nExactly, so let's send them a message.\n\nBARTLET\nNah.\n\nC.J\nSir.\n\nBARTLET\nFirst of all, it wasn't Danny.\n\nC.J.\nDanny is their representative. We have to stop being a punching bag and they\nneed a\nwake up call.\n\nBARTLET\nNah. It's going to look petty and petulant. You know why?\n\nC.J.\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nBecause it's petty and petulant.\n\nHe walks back to his desk. C.J follows him.\n\nC.J.\nNobody elected this newspaper, certainly not the 48 million people who chose\nyou to\nbe President.\n\nCharlie brings something in.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, but not having to run for anything tends to help with honesty and\ndecisiveness.\n[to Charlie] Thanks, Charlie, send Danny in, would you please?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nC.J.\nMr. President, you have to send them a message.\n\nBartlet takes off his glasses to look at C.J.\n\nBARTLET\nI really don't, C.J. [beat] Is this personal?\n\nC.J.\nExcuse me?\n\nBARTLET\nI hear things, I don't understand most of it, but I hear it.\n\nC.J.\nNo, sir, it's absolutely not personal.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's a great reporter, and you're a great Press Secretary. And that's why\nit was\nnever going to work while the two of you had those jobs.\n\nDanny comes in.\n\nC.J.\n[shocked] Sir, I...\n\nBARTLET\n[calling] Hey, Danny.\n\nC.J.\nYou...\n\nDANNY\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nDanny, I think you guys have had your heads up your asses for the last few\nweeks,\nI hope you don't mind me saying so.\n\nDANNY\nOf course not, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nNot only that, but I think you've been trying to bait me. Which is a waste\nof time,\npaper and ink. I'm like 50 times smarter than any of you will ever be. I\nhave an\nelection to win in two years, and I'm not about to alienate the Washington\nPost.\n\nDANNY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll tell you what I will do, though, I'm cancelling our subscription.\n\nC.J.\nExcellent, sir. The White House buys 1100 copies of the Post\neveryday. Cancelling\nthat subscription would send a message loud and clear.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, I meant just mine and Abbey's. I'll borrow a copy from somebody.\n\nCHARLIE\n[from the door] Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Take it easy, Danny. [beat] C.J.'ll give you all the access you want.\n\nDANNY\nThank you, sir.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe President leaves. C.J. and Danny are left looking at each other. Danny\nstarts\nto walk away.\n\nDANNY\nI have to go tell circulation we lost 32 dollars and 95 cents.\n\nC.J.\nI know about the job offer.\n\nDANNY\nI figured.\n\nC.J.\nKnown about it for a couple of days.\n\nDANNY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nYou don't want to be an editor?\n\nDANNY\nI'm a White House reporter.\n\nC.J.\nI know. I just thought, by taking a job outside the press room...\n\nDanny walks back up to C.J.\n\nDANNY\nC.J! I have no problem with a reporter dating the Press Secretary.\n\nC.J.\n[beat] Well, I have a problem, so...\n\nDANNY\nYeah. [beat] Okay, I'll see you later.\n\nC.J.\n[beat] Okay.\n\nDanny looks back at C.J. once as he walks out and leaves her standing, lost,\nin the\nmiddle of the Oval Office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT\nDonna is meeting with Vasily Konanov in the mural room. Mr Konanov's 'friend'\nand several\nSecret Service Agents are there too.\n\nDONNA\nSee, the keyboard forces users to put their wrists into a palms down position\nand\nencourages a sideways wrist twist to reach the enter key. That sideways\ntwist is called\nan alner-deviation and it's very bad. It has a right hand bias towards the\nimportant\nletter and number keys and frequently used keys like Enter, Shift, Backspace\nand Control\nare placed near the weakest finger, forces the wrist to absorb the added\npressure...\n\nKONANOV\nWhat in hell is the woman talking about?\n\nDONNA\nSir, I'm talking about my government's unwillingness to...\n\nThe President opens the double door of the Mural Room and strides in. Everyone\nstands.\n\nBARTLET\nVasily! Vasily Konanov, why you're the last person I expected to be where\nthey told\nme to go.\n\nHe shakes Konanov's hand.\n\nKONANOV\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you, Donna.\n\nDonna leaves.\n\nBARTLET\n[to the agents] Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nThe Secret Service Agents leave and close the doors behind them.\n\nBARTLET\nVasily?\n\nKONANOV\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\n[pointing to the woman] I don't know who this is.\n\nKONANOV\nAh!\n\nHe says something in Ukrainian. The woman picks up her stuff and leaves. She\ncurtsies\nto the President at the door. Konanov goes to sit down.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nKONANOV\n[standing up again] Mr. President, I would like to talk to you about\ncommercial\nlanding rights. I would like to talk to you about, I would like to talk to\nyou\nabout the World Trade Organization, and I would like to talk to you about\nnuclear\ncompatibility.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm not the transportation secretary. You will join the WTO when you reduce\nthe 300%\ntariff on America cars, and with a nuclear weapon pointed at my head I will\nnot talk\nto you about nuclear compatibility.\n\nKONANOV\n[desperate] Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nVasily, you're a reformer and you're going to do good things in Eastern\nEurope and I'm\nlooking forward to the day when you're President. But until that time comes,\nmy State\nDepartment deals with the government of the Ukraine. Now you can go home\nand so exactly\nwhat you wanted to do. [beat] To say you met with the President of the United\nStates.\n\nHe grips Konanov's hand.\n\nBARTLET\n[opening the door] You just did.\n\nThe President leaves a very happy Konanov in the Mural Room.

LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo is in his office, on the phone.\n\nLEO\n[to the phone] Yeah... yeah...\n\nSam and Ainsley come in. Leo holds up a finger.\n\nLEO\n[to the phone] Thank you. [to Sam] Doctor Zhivago is out of here.\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nLEO\nWhat do you have?\n\nSAM\nThe commerce department wants us to back an amendment to a Bill that would\nhelp\nsmall businesses with fraud prevention and employee theft. We want to\nrecommend it.\n\nLEO\nYou have numbers?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nSam gets out a folder and opens it for Leo.\n\nSAM\nThis is from an independent study that I have faith in. 30% of workers plan\nto steal\nfrom their employers, 30% give in to occasional temptation, 5% will commit\nfraud\nregardless of circumstances, 85% will commit fraud given the circumstances.\n\nLEO\nJust out of curiosity, what are the right circumstances?\n\nSAM\nNeed, opportunity and the ability to rationalize their behavior, it's called\nthe\nfraud triangle. Leo, it's going to help us out when we want to raise the\nminimum wage.\nIt's small business owners who are most opposed to wage hikes.\n\nLEO\nYou weren't going to go the other way on this?\n\nSAM\nYeah, I was.\n\nLEO\nYou got turned around?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nOkay, good.

You convinced me, I convinced Leo,\nLeo'll convince the President.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam, I...\n\nSAM\nIt's a short day, Ainsley, and a big country. We've got to move fast.\n\nAINSLEY\nIs it because I said in here, the President in there...\n\nSAM\nYup.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou've got to tell me when that's going to happen. Is this how you guys\ndecide\nto go to war?\n\nSAM\nI don't know, I'm usually not in the room when they do that.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam.\n\nSAM\n[calling out as he leaves] Someone get her a cupcake or something.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam.\n\nAinsley steps out of Sam's office. She looks around the COMMUNICATIONS\nOFFICE.\nWe follow her gaze as the camera pans in a complete circle. People are\nwalking\naround filing things, writing things, carrying things to and fro all at once.\nWe get back to Ainsley, who smiles, and walks off.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

The fact is the opponents of the treaty are on both sides of the\nisle.\nYou've got to respect them, Toby. They're politicians and they're flying in\nthe\nface of overwhelming public opinion.\n\nTOBY\nI have to respect senators for defying 82% of American people.\n\nBARTLET\nCan I tell you something, honestly? This is one of those situations where\nI couldn't\ngive a damn what the people think. The complexities of a global arms treaty,\nthe\ntechnological, the military, the diplomatic nuances, it's staggering,\nToby. 82% of\nthe people cannot possibly be expected to reach an informed decision. [beat]\nYou\nwant to call a session anyway?\n\nTOBY\nNo. [beat] No. If we lose, and we will, we're out of.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. [long pause] Anything else?\n\nTOBY\nNo, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nToby goes to leave.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know we forget sometimes, in all the talk about democracy we forget it's\nnot\na democracy, it's a republic. People don't make the decisions, they choose\nthe\npeople who make the decisions. Could they do a better job choosing? Yeah. But\nwhen you consider the alternatives, anyway, Abbey's in New Hampshire, you\nwant\nto come up for a cigar?\n\nToby doesn't answer.\n\nBARTLET\nThe day's over, Toby. We'll live to fight another one. Come up, and I'll beat\nyour ass at chess.\n\nTOBY\nAre you baiting me, Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nYes.\n\nTOBY\n[beat] Okay.\n\nToby follows the President out.\n\nBARTLET\n[calling ahead] If anyone's out there, I'm signing off. Have a good night.\n\nThe President opens the outside door and they leave. The Agent on the other\nside\ncloses it.

Charlie\ngently takes it\nand gazes at it for a moment.\n\nBARTLET\nTake a look.\n\nCharlie unties the red ribbon and opens the case to reveal the knife inside,\nin which he\nstares at it admiringly.\n\nBARTLET\nThe fully tapered bolster allows for sharpening the entire edge of the blade.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt says, 'P.R.' I thought I knew all, but I don't recognize the manufacturer.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. This was made for my family by a Boston silversmith named Paul Revere.\n\nCharlie swiftly looks up in surprise, much appreciation now seen in his\neyes. Behind him,\nC.J. quietly enters.\n\nC.J.\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm proud of you, Charlie.\n\nStill taken aback, Charlie gives him a soft response.\n\nCHARLIE\nThank you, sir. [beat] Five minutes in the Rose Garden.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nCharlie turns around to leave as C.J. stands at the back of the room,\nclearing her throat\nbefore speaking.\n\nC.J.\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nC.J.\nHi!\n\nBARTLET\nHi.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry to ask you this, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nNot too late to stop yourself.\n\nC.J.\nI need you to pardon a turkey.\n\nBARTLET\nI already pardoned a turkey.\n\nC.J.\nI need you to pardon another one.\n\nBARTLET\nDidn't I do it right?\n\nC.J.\nYou did it great, but I need you to come out here and pardon another one.\n\nBARTLET\nAren't I gonna get a reputation for being soft on turkeys?\n\nC.J.\nSir, could you come out here and just get this over with?\n\nBARTLET\nNo, I'm not just gonna get this--What the hell is going on?\n\nC.J.\n[approaches] They sent me two turkeys. The most photo-friendly of the two\ngets a\nPresidential pardon and a full life at a children's zoo. The runner-up gets\neaten.\n\nBARTLET\nIf the Oscars were like that, I'd watch.\n\nC.J.\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nJust buy the second turkey.\n\nC.J.\nThey already sold it.\n\nBARTLET\nThere's not much I can do.\n\nC.J.\nYou can pardon the turkey.\n\nBARTLET\nThe turkey hasn't committed a crime.\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nC.J., I have really no judicial jurisdiction over birds.\n\nC.J.\nYes, I know that, and you know that, but Morton Horn doesn't know that.\n\nBARTLET\nWho's Morton...?\n\nC.J.\nHe's a high school kid from the turkey place.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's in high school and he doesn't know I can't pardon his turkey?\n\nC.J.\nThat's what I'm betting.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J., if we don't and I mean completely overhaul public education in this\ncountry...\n\nC.J.\nYes sir, but maybe this is not the best time to...\n\nBARTLET\nWhere the hell is he?\n\nC.J.\nRight out there.\n\nBartlet immediately heads for the door, with C.J. following behind him.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nAs Bartlet and C.J. come out of the Oval Office, we see Donna and Morton by\nthe door of\nthe room near Charlie's desk. Troy, the turkey, is in front of them.\n\nC.J.\nMorton, this is President Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Morton.\n\nMORTON\nWow.\n\nBARTLET\nWell said. Is that the turkey?\n\nDONNA\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\n[to the turkey] You're pardoned.\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do you want?\n\nC.J.\n[with hand gestures] Well, you know...\n\nBARTLET\n[to the turkey again] By the power vested in me by the Constitution of the\nUnited States,\nI hereby pardon you.\n\nMORTON\n[pleased] Okay.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, it's not okay.\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nMorton, I can't pardon a turkey. If you think I can pardon a turkey, then\nyou have got\nto go back to your school and insist that you be better prepared to go out\nin the world.\n\nDONNA\nYou can't pardon a turkey?\n\nBARTLET\n[beat] No. I tell you what I can do. I'm drafting this turkey into military\nservice.\nIn the meantime, somebody will be drafting a check, which will have my\nsignature on it,\nso the folks can buy themselves a Butterball.\n\nMORTON\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nDonna, will you have Morton take Troy back to his pen, and remember to\nsupport his hindquarters.\n\nBARTLET\n[quietly to C.J.] What's wrong with him?\n\nC.J.\nThe turkey's hindquarters.\n\nAs Morton picks up Troy and walks off with Donna, Sam and Josh come in the\nroom.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Sam] I'm still waiting for the thing.\n\nSAM\n[holds up a folder] Right here.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go in.\n\nBartlet goes inside THE OVAL OFFICE. Josh and Sam follow, but C.J. stays\nbehind.\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nGive me two minutes.\n\nC.J.\n[points to the colonnade] I'm gonna step out there and begin the singing\nand lute playing.\n\nBARTLET [OS]\nWhatever!\n\nC.J. drops her hand and heads out the door.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet is on his way to go behind the desk. Josh and Sam stands in front.\n\nJOSH\nI'm assuming you've heard?\n\nBARTLET\nBy the way, the Latin word for 'yam' is 'dioscorea.'\n\nJOSH\nYou've heard.\n\nBARTLET\nAbout the Chinese refugees?\n\nSAM\nThey escaped.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Can you believe it?\n\nJOSH\nNo, as a matter of fact, neither one of us can believe it, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThat detention center was being guarded by the 22nd Division of the California\nNational\nGuard. Now, what does it say about our reserve army?\n\nSAM\nThat 83 men, women and children who haven't eaten in two months staged a\nprison break.\n\nBARTLET\nLet me read this.\n\nHe now has the folder in his hand, puts on his glasses, and starts to read\nfrom the paper inside.\n\nBARTLET\n'Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and bound\nby a common\ndesire for liberty, a small band of pilgrims sought out a place in the New\nWorld where\nthey could worship according to their own beliefs. Now therefore I, Josiah\nBartlet,\nPresident of the United States, by virtue of authority and laws vested in me,\ndo hereby\nproclaim this to be a National Day of Thanksgiving.'\n\nSAM\nI'll see you out there, sir.

We didn't do anything\nillegal.\nWe're not involved in any massive criminal conspiracy. There's no way I was\nletting\nthem go, and we needed to help China save face, so now they can tell their\npeople that\nthe mighty American military was overpowered by...\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nBartlet starts to head out to the colonnade.\n\nJOSH\nSo the guy passed the test, huh?\n\nBARTLET\nYou think I would've sent him back if he'd failed catechism? Let me tell\nyou something.\nWe can be the world's policeman. We can be the world's bank, the world's\nfactory, the\nworld's farm. What does it mean if we're not also...\n\nHe pauses for a moment, smiling a little. From a distance we hear several\nchildren\nstarting to sing.\n\nBARTLET\nWe've made it into the New World, Josh.

It\nreminded me of the\nway folks in my generation felt when we heard \"Yellow Submarine.\"\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nWe really did all want to live in a yellow submarine.\n\nC.J.\nI can't believe they gave you people drivers' licenses.\n\nBARTLET\nTell me where we're going again.\n\nC.J.\nMars briefing rehearsal.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nTo rehearse.\n\nBARTLET\nSay the name.\n\nC.J.\nI said the name.\n\nBARTLET\nSay it again.

You mind if I change it?\n\nTATE\nI'd prefer if you didn't.\n\nSAM\nJust the same...\n\nTATE\nThe Public Affairs has cleared the text.

First\nof all, you'll be\nflanked on either side by the Flight Operations Manager David Narakawa and\nNASA Chief\nAdministrator Dr. Peter Jobson. On either side of them will be Dr. Samuel\nThurman of the\nMeteorite Analysis team from the Johnson Space Center, and Dr. Joyce\nGrey-Sutton, Planetary\nGeologist from Cal State Northridge. On these monitors you'll be seeing the\nimages beamed\nback from the surface and on this computer screen you'll be able to read\nthe questions being\nsent in by the kids. I strongly urge you...\n\nBARTLET\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nI strongly urge you...\n\nBARTLET\nI know.\n\nC.J.\nI strongly urge you, Mr. President, to act as moderator and pass the questions\nof to one of\nthe experts on the panel rather than answer it yourself.\n\nBARTLET\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nWould you like to see some of the questions?\n\nBARTLET\nWe have questions in advance?\n\nC.J.\nSome of them. Would you put them on?\n\nCREWMEMBER [OS]\nSure.\n\nBartlet sits on one of the chairs in the front and reads from the computer\nmonitor.\n\nBARTLET\nKatie, sixth grade, Green Oaks Junior High School, Austin, Texas, asks,\n\"How old is the planet\nMars?\" That's a great question, Katie. The planet Mars is 4.6 billion years\nold.\n\nC.J.\nWhat did I just say?\n\nBARTLET\nI knew that one.\n\nC.J.\nNobody likes a know-it-all!\n\nBARTLET\nYes, God forbid, that while talking to 60,000 public school students, the\nPresident should\nappear smart!\n\nC.J.\nThat's fine. Just don't show off.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't show off. [reads again] Stevie, fourth grader, PS 31, Manhattan, asks,\n\"What is the\ntemperature on Mars?\" Well, Stevie, if one of our expert panelists were here,\nthey would tell\nyou the average temperature ranges from 15 degrees to minus 140.\n\nC.J.\n[looking through her papers] That happens to be wrong. It ranges from 60 to\nminus 225.\n\nBARTLET\nI converted it to Celsius in my head.\n\nC.J.\nThank you.\n\nBARTLET\nCan I see the intro?\n\nSAM\nIt's up on the Prompter.\n\nBARTLET\n[reads] \"Good morning!

I'm Scott Tate from NASA Public Affairs.\n\nBARTLET\n[gets up and shakes his hand] Scott. \"Unique\" means \"one of a kind.\" Something\ncan't be very\nunique, nor can it be extremely historic.\n\nC.J.\nWhile we're at it, do we have to use the word \"live\" twice in the first two\nsentences like we\njust cracked the technology?\n\nTATE\nLook...\n\nC.J.\nWe're also broadcasting in living color, right?\n\nBARTLET\nSam?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Tate] He's gonna make some changes.\n\nTATE\n[following Sam] You're going to clear them with me?\n\nSAM\nI doubt it.

LANDINGHAM\nGood Afternoon Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. What else?\n\nThey finally reach THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nCHARLIE\nFive is a reception for the U.A.W., and then you've got phone calls from\n5:30 to 6:30.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, but then, let's bring the curtain down. I got a great night planned. I\ngot two books\non Mars and one on Galileo himself. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\n[calls] Mrs. Landingham! [approaches Mrs. Landingham's desk]\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nNothing after 6:30.

LANDINGHAM\nI'm sure you're right. But I'm saying no, you won't be reading tonight. You're\nattending a\nconcert at the Kennedy Center.\n\nBARTLET\nSince when?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nMr. McGarry's office put it on your schedule.\n\nBARTLET\nGet me Leo!\n\nHe walks back into THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nCHARLIE\nI was about to tell you.

Iceland is considering defying the ban on whale hunting, imposed\nby the International\nWhaling Commission. They're in danger of joining Norway and Japan. There's\na lucrative\ninternational demand for fresh Icelandic mink whale meat.\n\nBARTLET\nIs this a joke?\n\nLEO\nNo sir. Needless to say both the State Department and the Fishery Subdivision\nof the\nDepartment of Agriculture feel that we shouldn't do anything to offend\nIceland right now.\n\nBARTLET\nWhich we did, by canceling the meeting yesterday.\n\nLEO\nApparently.\n\nBARTLET\nSo to make up for it, I'm going to see the Reykjavik Symphony.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWith, uh, Ambassador...\n\nLEO\nVigdis Olafsdottir.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nMrs. Landingham enters with papers for Bartlet and leaves.\n\nLEO\nHe's very excited to meet you.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll give you a thousand dollars if you don't make me go.\n\nLEO\nThink of the whales.\n\nBARTLET\nDo they vote?\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nIntelligence briefing.\n\nBARTLET\nSend them in.\n\nThree Intelligence officers enter.\n\nLEO\nThis might be something.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nThere was an explosion in a Russian oil refinery.\n\nBARTLET\nAh.\n\nJACK\nGood Afternoon Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Jack. Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nGentlemen, please.\n\nCharlie leaves as everyone sits.\n\nBARTLET\nThere was an explosion?\n\nJACK\nWell, INTARTASS is reporting that there is a fire burning in an oil refinery\nin Kozelsk.\n\nLEO\nIt's in the Oblast region?\n\nJACK\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's the problem Jack?\n\nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER 1\nThere is no oil refinery in Kozelsk.\n\nLEO\nOh man.\n\nINTELLIGENCE OFFICER 2\nThe closest oil refinery is about twenty kilometers southeast.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not a refinery fire?\n\nLEO\nIt's a missile silo.\n\nBARTLET\nThere was an explosion in a missile silo?\n\nJACK\nWe can't confirm that at this point, but the Russians have twenty SS19's in\nthe quadrant\nand Keyhole has pictures of a column of smoke, emergency personnel on the\nground, but no\nburning structure. Certainly no oil refinery.\n\nBARTLET\nIf a missile exploded, is it possible it was armed? Was there a warhead?\n\nJACK\nWe can put together a briefing for you in an hour.\n\nLEO\nHalf hour, Jack.\n\nJack looks at one of the other officers, then nods at Leo.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nJACK\nThank you, sir.\n\nThe Intelligence officers exit.\n\nBARTLET\nDid they really think we weren't gonna see it, Leo?\n\nLEO\nIt's a cold war mentality.\n\nBARTLET\nIf they asked, we could help.\n\nLEO\nI wouldn't wait for the phone to ring.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Yeah. Galileo Galilei. He sat in a cathedral in Pisa. He watched a\nlamp suspended from\nthe ceiling as it oscillated back and forth. He used his pulse to keep time\nand discovered\nthat the period of oscillation was independent of the size of the arc. A\nfew years later he\ncontradicted the theory that a heavier body falls faster than a lighter\none.

Let me say first that you were right and I was wrong.\n\nTOBY\nAnd the odds makers take a beating.\n\nC.J.\nWhen I said before no one was going to pick it up?\n\nTOBY\nYes?\n\nC.J.\nEverybody's picked it up.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nAnd when I said that even if they did, it wouldn't be a big deal?\n\nTOBY\nYes?\n\nC.J.\nTurns out, it's a bit of a deal.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nYou know where?\n\nTOBY\nIn Oregon?\n\nC.J.\nIn Oregon. You know why?\n\nTOBY\nBecause they're a major producer of green beans?\n\nC.J.\nThey're a huge producer, Toby. Green beans, or snap beans, represent a\nsignificant percentage\nof Oregon's annual revenue. But here's the thing... [starts to sit]\n\nTOBY\nThere's an electoral problem?\n\nC.J.\n[standing back up] There's an electoral problem. We won Oregon by less than\n10,000 votes and\nwe're going to need them.\n\nTOBY\n[smiles knowingly] Yeah.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, well, I'm on it now.

Yes.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do you think happened?\n\nOFFICER\nMr. President, every morning at your intelligence briefing 7 days a week\nyou're told about the\ntroubling state of the Russian military. I think you just saw evidence of it.\n\nLEO\nYou think somebody screwed up?\n\nOFFICER\nI think either somebody screwed up or a computer did. You wanna know the\ntruth? I think an\nearly warning ballistic missile system and the troops running it mistakenly\ndetected a bogey\nfrom a flock of Norwegian geese.\n\nAn aide hands Bartlet a note.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere are we with the Russian ambassador?\n\nFEMALE OFFICER\nShe's still claiming it's an oil refinery fire.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, I want you to see her as soon as she can get here.

JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\nDonna and Josh are still on the stamp assignment.\n\nDONNA\n[irritated] It's a stamp!\n\nJOSH\nYes, but we have to remain neutral.\n\nDONNA\n[louder] It's a stamp!\n\nJOSH\nI understand that it's a stamp but I'm saying when it comes to statehood\nfor Puerto Rico,\nthe United States has to remain neutral.\n\nDONNA\nPuerto Rico's in the United States.\n\nJOSH\nOnce again, thanks for that review of fifth grade social studies. But I\nmeant the federal\ngovernment must remain neutral.\n\nDONNA\nPuerto Rico is in the federal government.\n\nJOSH\nNo, it's not.\n\nDONNA\nThey send a resident commissioner to Congress.\n\nJOSH\nWho can't vote. But that's beside the point.\n\nDONNA\nWhat is the point?\n\nJOSH\n[walks to the copy machine] Aquino was strongly in favor of statehood. To\nput his face on a\nstamp would be promoting his beliefs. We can't do that.\n\nDONNA\nBecause we have to remain neutral?\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nDONNA\nThat's idiotic.\n\nJOSH\nOh, like it's the first time.\n\nDONNA\nHe voiced an opinion so he can't be on a stamp?\n\nJOSH\n[sighs]\nDonna.\n\nHe turns to walk down the hall. Donna follows him.\n\nDONNA\nSides have been taken: former Presidents, the Speaker, Minority Leader. They\nall said that\nstatehood is in the long-term interest of Puerto Rico and that, as it stands,\n3.8 million\nAmerican citizens have been relegated to second-class status! That's more\npeople than Mississippi!\n\nJosh has poured himself a cup of coffee and stirs it.\n\nJOSH\nMississippi's never minded being relegated to second-class status.\n\nDONNA\nOh you're going to make your little bigoted Mississippi jokes?\n\nJOSH\nYes, I am. [walks]\n\nDONNA\nIsn't anyone worried that if they're not given statehood, they're going to\nwant independence?\n\nJOSH\nExactly no one is worried about that. You know why? [stops] Because Puerto\nRico is absolutely\ndependent on U.S. manufacturing, which contributes 40 percent to the GDP\nand accounts for 24\npercent of their workforce.\n\nDONNA\nI don't care! People don't sit still for tyranny!\n\nJOSH\nHow's it tyranny?\n\nDONNA\nPuerto Ricans have to register to be drafted into the armed forces, yet\nthey're not allowed to\nvote for President. They're expected to die for a Commander-in-Chief they\nhad no voice in electing?\n\nJOSH\nDonna...\n\nDONNA\nWe have colonized Puerto Rico and they will rise up against us.\n\nJOSH\nI think we can take 'em. [walks away]\n\nDONNA\nThat's what we said about the British.\n\nJOSH\n[turns to look at her] We took the British.\n\nDONNA\nYou know what I'm saying.\n\nJOSH\nHardly ever.\n\nToby strides down the hall quickly toward Josh.\n\nTOBY\nJosh...\n\nJOSH\nWhat's going on?\n\nTOBY\nThey know it entered the Martian atmosphere at 3:01 p.m. Eastern, which it\nwas supposed to do.\n\nHe follows Josh to the copy machine and to JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nTOBY\nThey know it was on course traveling at a rate of 15,400 miles per hour,\nwhich it was supposed to.\nSomewhere during its descent it was also supposed to release two probes --\neach about the size of\na basketball -- firing them deep into the ground as part of the mission's\nsearch for evidence of\nwater under surface.\n\nJOSH\nWe think if we hit the ground hard enough, we can make it to the center of\nthe planet and find\nwater?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nThat's not a theory of physics pretty much disproved by Wile E. Coyote?\n\nTOBY\nThe probes were supposed to send a signal back to Earth through the Global\nSurveyor Orbiter.\n\nJOSH\nAnd we haven't gotten the signal?\n\nTOBY\nThe last the flight controllers heard from Galileo was 11 minutes before\nlanding, when all\nsystems were operating normally. Then it entered what they call a\ncommunications blackout\nperiod and it hasn't been heard from since. [beat] I know how it feels.\n\nJOSH\nWhat are they trying?\n\nTOBY\nThey're... uh... trying the things they try. I'm going to give it an hour\nand then tell Leo\nwe got to cancel the classroom.\n\nDONNA\n[from the other room] Josh!\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nDONNA\nThe stamp?\n\nJOSH\n[to Toby] You were supposed to do this, you know.\n\nTOBY\nI delegated.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nToby comes out of Josh's office.

And it's\ngoing to be weird\nbecause we haven't spoken to one another since the picture, which was wrong,\nI know. But I'm\nnot even sure there was an implied obligation to do that.\n\nC.J. stops to talk to Carol. Toby and Sam continue walking.\n\nSAM [cont.]\nPlease, let's remember, it's not like we were dating. It was a flirtation. We\nhad one date.\nThe rest were all with groups of people and...\n\nSam stops and Toby does too.\n\nSAM [cont.]\nI don't know, I don't even know what dating is anymore.\n\nTOBY\nWell, that's 20 seconds of my life I'm never going to get back.\n\nC.J. catches up to them and takes Sam's hand, pulling him with her.\n\nC.J.\nLet's go.\n\nToby watches them go as we stop by LEO'S OFFICE.

And you're having your suits handmade now.\n\nLEO\nNadia, are you hitting on me?\n\nNADIA\nI was sorry to hear about your divorce.\n\nLEO\n[irritated] You have a fire in a missile silo.\n\nNADIA\nIt is an oil refinery.\n\nLeo grabs a folder and holds it up as he walks toward her.\n\nLEO\nThese are Keyhole satellite photographs. Would you point, please, to the\noil refinery in\nthese pictures?\n\nNADIA\nI'm not at liberty to comment on matters of national security.\n\nLEO\nCan you tell me how an oil refinery explosion would affect national security?\n\nNADIA\nThis is really a matter to be taken up with the Foreign Minister.\n\nLEO\nNo, I'm taking it up with the Russian Ambassador to the United States.

Look, just, from now on, there's no food the President\ndoesn't like, okay?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nI have to take this outside.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nC.J. heads out, and Charlie goes the other way.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

KENNEDY CENTER - SIDE TERRACE - CONTINUOUS\nC.J. comes out of the building into the quiet terrace, where several people\nare hanging out.\nShe is now talking to Toby on the cell phone.\n\nC.J.\nI'm out in back. I'm on the terrace. I passed Gary Saunders on the way\nout. He booed me.\nI swear to God. I passed by. He went 'boo!'\n\nTOBY [VO]\nWho's Gary Saunders?\n\nC.J.\nHe's the Deputy Spokesperson at the Department of Energy.\n\nTOBY [VO]\nYou didn't hire him?\n\nC.J.\nI promoted Simon Glazer. I promoted from within, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nAnyway, they're hypothesizing that the thing came down at an odd angle,\nand that its position\nmight be preventing the antennae from establishing a downlink. They say\nit'll take a few days\nto try everything they want to try.\n\nC.J.\nDays?\n\nTOBY [VO]\nYeah.\n\nC.J. sees someone behind her and quickly looks away.\n\nC.J.\nOh, God.\n\nTOBY\n[with a chuckle] Look, if this is the worst thing that happens...\n\nC.J.\nNo. Tad Whitney's coming over to me.\n\nTOBY [VO]\nYou interviewed Tad?\n\nC.J.\nOh, God.

C.J. shakes her head,\nas TAD WHITNEY\ncomes up behind her.\n\nTAD WHITNEY\nHey, C.J.\n\nC.J. holds up her index finger, pretending to talk to someone on the cell\nphone.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, okay. Well, we're gonna put those figures out at the morning\nbriefing... Yeah. Thank you.\n[hangs up]\n\nTAD\nWhat was that about?\n\nC.J.\nI... you know... I honestly couldn't tell you.\n\nTAD\nI saw you come out.\n\nC.J.\nYeah. There's some stuff going on.\n\nTAD\nI didn't get the gig, huh?\n\nC.J.\nI gave it to Simon Glazer.\n\nTAD\nI heard.\n\nC.J.\nI promoted from within.\n\nTAD\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nPromoting from within is very big in my family.\n\nTAD\nYeah. I'm surprised 'cause I'm pretty qualified. In fact, there's a lot of\npeople at State\nwho thought I was a lock.\n\nC.J.\nYou're very qualified.\n\nTAD\nYeah. And it wasn't because I'm a man.\n\nC.J.\nWell, no. Simon Glazer's a man.\n\nTAD\nI suppose.\n\nC.J.\nHey!\n\nTAD\nAnd it wasn't because I stopped seeing you.\n\nC.J.\nTad, it honestly was a matter of Simon... [beat] No! Of course it didn't\nhave anything to\ndo with... That was six weeks, five years ago.\n\nTAD\nBecause I thought you might want an explanation as to why I did.\n\nC.J.\nWhy you did what?\n\nTAD\nWhy I stopped calling you.\n\nC.J.\nI don't need an explanation.\n\nTAD\nBelieve me, it wasn't because you were bad in bed or anything like that.\n\nC.J.\nNo, I didn't think it was, Tad.\n\nTAD\nI mentioned it because I know a lot of women who worry about that.\n\nC.J.\nI don't.\n\nTAD\nYou're good in bed.\n\nC.J.\nI'm great in bed!\n\nThree men near them heard C.J.'s remark and looks at her.\n\nC.J.\n[to the men] How you doing?\n\nTAD\nC.J....\n\nC.J.\nTad, you know, I'm sorry you didn't get the job, but there's really no...\n\nTAD\nYou're really gonna stand there and tell me this isn't personal?\n\nC.J.\nI really am.\n\nTAD\nI think it is. I think it's personal, and I think it's unprofessional. And\nI think people\nare gonna know about this. And I think you've got a problem now.\n\nC.J.\nI have a number of problems today, and you're not close to being any of them.\n\nTAD\nWell, I was hoping we could be adult about this.\n\nC.J.\nI have to go. You're gonna get a briefing in about an hour.\n\nC.J. starts to head back to the building.\n\nTAD\nOn what?\n\nC.J.\nA Russian missile silo.\n\nTAD\nListen. Um...\n\nC.J.\nYeah?\n\nTAD\nPlaying along with this for a moment... Is there anything I should do to\nprove my chances\nnext time around?\n\nC.J.\nWell, when we run for reelection, I'd vote for somebody else.\n\nC.J. turns around and heads back.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT\nSam, sitting on the passenger seat of the open car, talks to Josh on the\nphone.\n\nSAM\nCan you read the last part back to me?\n\nJOSH\n'The flight manager at J.P.L. will be working round the clock until all hope\nis exhausted.'\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\nI'll give it to Carol.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nIs she there?\n\nSAM\nMallory?\n\nJOSH [VO]\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nYeah, she's here. She snuck up on me from behind. You'd think women would\nmake more noise\nwith their big high heels, but they don't. They got this stealth thing going,\nwhich I really\nought to be clever enough--\n\nMallory appears on the other side of the car and taps on the window. Sam\nlooks, but quickly\nturns away, a little surprised.\n\nSAM\nOh my God.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nWhat was that?\n\nSAM\nNothing.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nShe's there, right?\n\nSAM\n[stands]\nYeah.\n\nMallory starts to go around the car and stands in front of Sam.\n\nJOSH\nHow's she look?\n\nSAM\nShe looks pretty good.\n\nJOSH\nCan you describe what she's wearing?\n\nSAM\nWell, yeah, 'cause she's standing right in front of me.\n\nJOSH\nSo you want to get off the phone?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. [hangs up]\n\nMALLORY\nYou know what I think?\n\nSAM\nWhat?\n\nMALLORY\nI think you're caught between wanting to be mad, and wanting good seats for\nhome games.\n\nSAM\nI get pretty good seats as it is, Mallory. I don't know if you noticed the\nmotorcade I\nrode over in.\n\nMALLORY\nI talked to my dad. I'm sorry about Galileo.\n\nSAM\nThey've got a lot of tests they can still try.\n\nMALLORY\nHow much money is it gonna cost to try them?\n\nSAM\nDon't start with me.\n\nMALLORY\nI'm asking as a taxpayer. It cost 165 million dollars to lose the thing. How\nmuch more money\nis it gonna cost to make sure you're never gonna find it?\n\nSAM\nI don't know, Mallory, but we certainly won't divert any municipal tax dollars,\nwhich are\nalways best spent on new hockey arenas.\n\nMALLORY\nNo, it's best spent feeding, housing and educating.\n\nSAM\nThere are a lot of hungry people in the world, Mal, and none of them are\nhungry because we\nwent to the moon. None of them are colder, and certainly none of them are\ndumber 'cause we\nwent to the moon.\n\nMALLORY\nAnd we went to the moon. Do we really have to go to Mars?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nMALLORY\nWhy?\n\nSAM\n'Cause it's next. For we came out of the cave, and we looked over the hill,\nand we saw fire.\nAnd we crossed the ocean, and we pioneered the West, and we took to the\nsky. The history of\nman is hung on the timeline of exploration, and this is what's next.\n\nMALLORY\nI know.\n\nSAM\nPeople like you, who say that... [beat] What?\n\nMALLORY\nI said I know. We're supposed to be explorers.\n\nSAM\nThen what the hell?\n\nMALLORY\nI just want to hear you talk about it.\n\nSAM\nYou know something?\n\nMALLORY\nYou get all puffed up.\n\nSAM\nYou're a pain in the ass.\n\nMALLORY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nAnyway... look, about the picture...\n\nMALLORY\nDon't worry about it.\n\nSAM\nYou're not pissed?\n\nMALLORY\nI'm totally pissed, but I'm saying don't worry about it tonight.\n\nC.J.\n[walks up] Sam?\n\nSAM\nYeah? [to Mallory] I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nMALLORY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nHey, Mal.\n\nMALLORY\nHey, C.J.\n\nC.J.\n[to Sam] Let me see what you got.\n\nSAM\nThis'll be for tonight's briefing, but doesn't include the notes from J.P.L.\n\nC.J.\nCan I talk to Jason Stark?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\n\nDONNA\n[yells] Aha!\n\nJosh sees Donna stand up and shout with her arms raised.\n\nJOSH\nWhat you got there?\n\nDONNA\nPrecedent, baby!\n\nJOSH\nPrecedent?\n\nDONNA\nPrecedent. The mother's milk of you know, making your point and being right.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nDONNA\nThe Jewish War Veterans lobbied to get a stamp, even though the criteria\nprohibits people\nor groups whose principal undertakings are religious.\n\nJOSH\nRight, and what happened?\n\nDONNA\nThe J.W.V. argues that their principal achievements have been fighting wars\nfor their\ncountry, just like Aquino.\n\nJOSH\nRight. What happened?\n\nDONNA\nThey were denied.\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nDONNA\nOkay. That doesn't help me.\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nJosh walks away, Donna following.\n\nDONNA\n[flipping pages] Hang on!\n\nJOSH\nLook...\n\nDONNA\nThe Luna Moth has its own stamp.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's a Luna Moth?\n\nDONNA\nIt's a moth, and you don't see the National Organization of Entomologists\nfreaking out.\n\nJOSH\nNo, but I'd pay good money to see that.\n\nDONNA\n[flipping pages again] Hang on. Hang on.\n\nJOSH\nDonna...\n\nDONNA\nAha!\n\nJOSH\nHere we go.\n\nThe phone rings as Josh and Donna enter JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nDONNA\nThe following groups have been issued stamps: Disabled Veterans of America,\nAmerican Confederate\nVeterans, American Legion and its black soldiers who served as buffalo scouts\nin the West.\n\nJOSH\nUh, are you gonna get that?\n\nDONNA\nI-I meant in the 19th century. The black soldiers from the West.\n\nJOSH\nYeah. I didn't think we still had buffalo scouts. [picks up phone] Josh Lyman.\n\nDONNA\nThe guy should be able to be on a stamp.\n\nJOSH\n[into phone] Okay. [hangs up]\n\nDONNA\nWhat was that?\n\nJOSH\nThe President's back.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo's meeting continues.\n\nNADIA\nAny inspection team will have to include neutral representatives.\n\nLEO\nWho do you want?\n\nNADIA\nThe Finns.\n\nLEO\nI'll take it to the State Department. They're not gonna want limits on the\ninspection team.\n\nNADIA\nNo one enters the country without our approval.\n\nLEO\nThey'll agree to notification, if not approval.\n\nNADIA\nAnd I'm going to insist on notification and approval. In addition, results\nfrom the inspection\nwill remain in the country.\n\nLEO\nNadia...\n\nNADIA\nLeo, soil samples, carbon residue, photographs and photographic negatives...\n\nLEO\nListen...\n\nNADIA\nAll that must remain under Russian control.\n\nPresident Bartlet, who has sneaked inside the office behind Nadia, slams\nthe door behind him\nand makes his presence known. Leo and the Nadia stand up.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Nadia] Your paranoia was a lot sexier back when you guys are communists.\n\nNADIA\nMr. President. How good to see you.\n\nBARTLET\nFrom where do you get the nerve and try to dictate terms on this? Are you\ninsane? Your missile\nregimen is in a horrifying state of disrepair. Your best-trained operators\nhave left or died.\nThe ones you've got aren't paid very much when they're paid at all. They\ndon't have enough to\ntrain with. Your ICBMs are well behind their warranty life. Not seven weeks\nago, you mistook\na Norwegian weather rocket for a submarine launch Trident missile because\nthe CrossTac\ninformation never made it to the Russian C&amp;C system. [looks at Leo] Leo,\nat the time the\nS.S.19 exploded, it was being drained of its liquid hydrogen in an attempt\nby deserting\nsoldiers to -- wait for it --\n\nLEO\nSteal the warhead?\n\nBARTLET\nSteal the warhead! [beat] When were you gonna tell us about that? You realize\nhow dangerous...\n\nNADIA\nMr. President, you shouldn't be concerned with the welfare of the Russian\npeople.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I am concerned with the welfare of the Russian people, but that's not\nwhat they pay\nme for. You guys fall asleep in the switch in Minsk, and I've got a whole\nhemisphere hiding\nunder the bed. How do you not tell us this is going on? How do you not ask\nus for help?\n\nNADIA\nWe'll not need help finding the leaders of the black market network -\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, thanks. We're sending in NATO inspectors.\n\nNADIA\nLeo and I were just discussing the terms.\n\nLEO\nThe terms are we're sending in NATO inspectors, or he's taking a walk to\nthe pressroom.\n\nBARTLET\nGet your Foreign Minister on the phone.\n\nHe walks to the door and opens it, but turns around to make a point.\n\nBARTLET\nI really don't know from where you guys get the nerve.\n\nNADIA\nFrom a long, hard winter, Mr. President.\n\nA few seconds of exchanging looks, then Bartlet goes into his office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nThe four murmuring senior aides, Toby, C.J., Josh and Sam did not notice\nbartlet as he comes in.\nHe takes off his jacket and goes behind his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nThis is still my office, right?\n\nTOBY\nSir, we have some press things for discussion.\n\nBARTLET\nNothing new from NASA?\n\nSAM\nThey're testing the idea that it may have turned into what's called a 'safe\nmode.' If it\nsensed trouble, it's programmed to turn its systems off to avoid further\ndamage and wait\nfor instructions from earth.\n\nBARTLET\nEarth's giving it instructions?\n\nSAM\nIt's not responding.\n\nBARTLET\nLike my kids. All right...\n\nC.J.\nSir, that leaves us with the televised classroom, the green beans...\n\nJOSH\nThe stamp.\n\nC.J.\n...the stamp, and depending on who those people were that were standing near\nme, the\npossibility of a story about me being good in bed.\n\nTOBY\n[suddenly looks up] Good in bed?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nBecause I am.\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nGreen beans?\n\nTOBY\n[while giving C.J. weird looks] Let's do a photo-op with the\nPresident... eating green beans.\nWe can drop in a quote. He's always looking for new green bean... recipes.\n\nJOSH\nNext time we're in California, we schedule a pop in Oregon, make sure\nnothing's burned down.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, okay. What about the stamp?\n\nJOSH\nHere's the thing, the Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee...\n\nC.J.\n[whispers to Toby] He doesn't like green beans.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry, sir. Nothing.\n\nJOSH\nThe Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee...\n\nC.J.\nNo, I'm sorry. I said you don't like green beans, sir.\n\nTOBY\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nHe doesn't enjoy them. He doesn't think they're bad for you, and he doesn't\nthink the people\nwho make them are evil. They're simply not his cup of tea. He doesn't care\nfor them. Why do\nwe think the adults of Oregon would be okay with that if put to them just\nthat way?\n[turns to Josh on her left] And Josh, why do you think the people, adult\nAmericans, why do\nyou think they can't understand that we can honor a man's contribution\nwithout necessarily\nsubscribing to his politics? They can understand a lot of things. People\nstopped trusting\nthe government during Vietnam, and it was because government stopped trusting\nthem. It's a\ncautionary tale, Josh.\n\nJOSH\n[beat] Okay. I was gonna say I think we should put them on a stamp.\n\nC.J.\nOh... Okay. Good.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. Everybody go away. We'll call you back when there's a NASA update.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nJOSH\nThank you, sir.\n\nJosh and C.J. continue to whisper to each other while walking out. Bartlet\ngoes to a side table.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J.?\n\nC.J. approaches.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you hear the end of the concert?\n\nC.J.\nI didn't hear much of the concert at all. How was it?\n\nHe takes a cigar and lights it.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, first of all, let's not kid ourselves. The Reykjavik Symphony can\nplay. These guys have\nsome serious game. In this particular case, their talents were tragically\nmisapplied to an\natonal nightmare of pretention, but after intermission...\n\nHe heads outside to the COLONNADE to smoke his cigar as C.J. follows. He\nwalks to a pillar\nand looks up to the night sky.\n\nC.J.\nAfter intermission?\n\nBARTLET\nThey played a piece by a new composer. First, I wasn't hearing it. I had 19\ndifferent things\non my mind, but then I did, and C.J., it was magnificent. It was genius. He\nbuilt these themes,\nand at the beginning, it was just an intellectual exercise, which is fun\nenough, I guess,\nbut then in the fourth movement, he just let it go. I really didn't think\nI could be surprised\nby music anymore. I thought about all the times this guy must've heard that\nhis music was no\ngood... I've got to write this guy a letter.\n\nC.J.\nMr. President, about that televised classroom tomorrow...\n\nBARTLET\nI'm gonna wait up for a while. See if we hear anything. It's out there\nsomewhere... It's so close.\n\nC.J.\nI think you should do the classroom either way.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nC.J.\nWe have, at our disposal, a captive audience of schoolchildren. Some of them\ndon't go to the\nblack board and raise their hand 'cause they think they're gonna be wrong. I\nthink you should\nsay to these kids you think you get it wrong sometimes, you should come down\nhere and see how\nthe big boys do it. I think you should tell them you haven't given up hope,\nand that it may\nturn up, but in the meantime, you want NASA to put its best people in the\nroom, and you want\nthem to start building Galileo VI. Some of them will laugh, and most of them\nwon't care, but\nfor some, they might honestly see that it's about going to the blackboard\nand raising your hand.\n[beat] And that's the broader theme.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll say.\n\nC.J.\nI'll be in my office, Mr. President.\n\nC.J. heads back inside, turning around to the President's call.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nYou said it right that time.\n\nC.J.\n[with a smile] I'll be in my office.\n\nThe Agent opens the door for C.J. as she goes back inside. Overhead, we see\nBartlet\nlooking up at the sky again as he speaks to no one in particular.\n\nBARTLET\nTalk to us.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nroduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

Katie?\n\nKATIE\nC.J., last night the energy secretary gave a speech at the Natural Resource\nDefense\nCouncil about the perils of drilling on the North Slope. During a Q&amp;A he\nwas asked about\ntapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help ease oil prices. He\nresponded that\nthe idea had a lot of merit. Does this signal a shift in policy since last\nJune?\n\nC.J. glances at Sam who gives her a small nod.\n\nC.J.\nNo, it doesn't, but I will say that a bad idea in June isn't necessarily a\nbad idea in\nDecember.\n\nKATIE\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nYou don't need to lower the price of heating oil during the summer.

Everyone stands.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's going on? Sit down.\n\nMAN 1\nMr. President an F16 Falcon from the 27-fighter wing at Cannon Air Force\nBase in New\nMexico has left his group.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat does that mean?\n\nKEN\nReturning home from an exercise the flight leader visually realized that\nthe tail plane\nwas no longer in formation.\n\nMAN 1\nThere was no communication from the aircraft and now it refuses to respond\nto urgent\nradio calls.\n\nBARTLET\nIs he in there alone? Is there a crew?\n\nLEO\nThe Falcon is a single seat fighter.\n\nBARTLET\nDid he crash?\n\nMAN 2\nIf he crashed he would have triggered electronic signals that would have\nbeen picked up\nby ground base.\n\nBARTLET\nIs there any chance he's trying to contact the ground and can't?\n\nMAN 1\nMassive collapse of this plane's communication system isn't very likely.\n\nLEO\nKen, what does he have up there?\n\nKEN\nWell he's got a 20mm Vulcan cannon and 7 AIM sidewinder missiles.\n\nBARTLET\nIs his intention to defect with a military asset or his intention to blow\nsomething up?\n\nMAN 1\nWe don't know what his intention is.\n\nBARTLET\nDon't our fighter pilors have to go through some kind of psychological\ntesting?\n\nKEN\nOh they go through extensive screening sir. He was deemed psychologically\nfit to fly.\n\nBARTLET\nLet me ask a ridiculous question and I know the answer is no. Is there any\nway to bring\nthis plane down without shooting it down?\n\nMAN 1\nNo sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat about populated areas?\n\nKEN\nWe can take him over the Sierra Madres.\n\nMAN 1\nMr. President, it's possible the pilot lost consciousness due to a dramatic\nloss of air\npressure and that's why this is happening.\n\nMAN 2\nWe've scrambled F16 out of Edwards to get a visual sighting.\n\nMAN 1\nIf the pilot is dead they'll see signs in the cockpit, if he's conscious\nhe'll know he's\nbeen painted and he'll be given an order by the interceptors to land at a\ndesignated area.\n\nKEN\nIf he doesn't that's when we make a decision.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah okay.\n\nSTANLEY [VO]\nAnd that's the first time you heard about the pilot?\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Josh jumps. We flash to Josh in a white\ndress shirt\nand undone tie at home as someone knocks on his door. He looks very startled\nand his\nhand is bleeding.

It's all in the report. It wasn't a problem.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but it made it to the Press Room, so I just wanted to check in.\n\nBERNARD\nThe guide was pointing out the Gustave Callioux hanging outside the Blue\nRoom.\n\nC.J. nods.\n\nBERNARD\nA woman began screaming completely incoherently.\n\nC.J.\nIn English?\n\nBERNARD\nIf it was a language at all, its origin was unknown to me.

This\nis a\npainting of the cliffs of Etretat, cleverly titled \"The Cliffs of Etretat. It\nis a minor\nwork.\n\nC.J.\nWhat's it doing here?\n\nBERNARD\nIt was on loan from the Musee d'Orsay to the National Gallery. The President,\non a visit\nto the gallery, and possessing even less taste in fine art than you have in\naccessories,\nannounced that he liked the painting. The French government offered it as\na gift to the\nWhite House. [Both stop walking.] I suppose in retribution for EuroDisney.

You're pissed at Sam, you're pissed at Toby, you're pissed at C.J.,\nyou're\npissed at Donna. Who's next?\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY OF THE PARTY\nA meeting is happening involving the men of the staff.

THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY OF THE PARTY\n\nBARTLET\nOPEC will find a way to punish us.\n\nLeo, Sam and Josh are standing in front of him.\n\nSAM\nThe Saudis have announced that they'd welcome the US tapping into the SPR\nto calm the\nmarket. Even the Saudis think that the price is too high.\n\nBARTLET\nIf the Saudis are that concerned, why don't they just make the old faster?\n\nSAM\nWell, they're not that concerned.\n\nBARTLET\nI didn't think so.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MEETING ROOM - PRESENT\nJosh has his bandaged hand in front view on the table.\n\nJOSH\nIt was Sam's meeting. He wanted the President to get together with his Energy\nand\nEconomic advisors on the SPR. I was only there for a political perspective.\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat does that mean?\n\nJOSH\nThere are only two things that ever stopped the government from doing anything\nmoney or\npolitics.\n\nSTANLEY\nSo, you were there to say it was a bad idea politically?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nSTANLEY\nDid you think it was?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nSTANLEY\nDid you say so?\n\nJOSH\nI'm paid to say so!\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat'd you say?\n\nJOSH\nI told him to...

We're setting up a meeting. [about to walk out of the office]\n\nSAM\nExcellent!\n\nJOSH\nCan I say I think it's a bad idea?\n\nBARTLET\n[stops and turns to Josh] Why?\n\nJOSH\nIt's not something Didion's gonna like.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I'm just talking about a meeting, but if I decide to do it, the\nPresident controls\nthe SPR and not Congress.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, but Didion controls the IMF vote.\n\nBARTLET\nThe two aren't related.\n\nLEO\nLet's move on.\n\nJOSH\nThe two are related!\n\nBARTLET\nHow?\n\nJOSH\nThrough Didion.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm saying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and forgiving the IMF debt are\nnot related.\n\nLEO\nAnything else?\n\nJOSH\n[ignoring Leo] Of course they're related.\n\nLEO\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nIf Didion doesn't like that we're tapping into the SPR, he won't let the\nIMF debt out\nof committee.\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll talk to him tonight.\n\nJOSH\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nAt the Christmas party, we'll take him aside...\n\nJOSH\n[raises his voice a bit] No, sir, you can't just take him aside...\n\nLEO\nJosh, we can move on...\n\nJOSH\n[puts his hand in front of Leo's face] We can't move on from it!\n\nSAM\nJosh...\n\nJOSH\nWe can't just take him aside! If we tell him we need his help then we give\nhim visibility\nand power, and we put him in a position to say 'no' and be a hero to his\nparty! Who\nwouldn't want to do that for a living?\n\nBARTLET\nJosh, Didion's a good guy, we can talk to him.\n\nJosh walks very close to the President, waves his hands wildly.\n\nJOSH\nYou need to listen to me. You have to listen to me. I can't help you, unless\nyou listen\nto me! You can't send Christmas cards to everyone, you can't do it! [yelling]\nForget the\nSPR, let's get the IMF loans like we said we were going to, listen to what\nI have to say\nabout Didion, and please, listen to me!\n\nEveryone is looking at each other, lost. Josh's breathing heavily, and for\na long moment,\nhis breathing is the only sound heard.\n\nSAM\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nAll right, let's move on.\n\nLEO\nJosh, go wait in my office, would you?\n\nJOSH\nI suppose if it's just a meeting, we...\n\nLEO\nWait in my office.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nHe walks out while the conversation carries on awkwardly.\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll talk with Didion tonight?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nBy the way, it's not intervention in a free market if that's what he's\nworried about.\n\nSAM\nI agree!\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not free trade if the price of oil is being controlled by a cartel.\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nSam, you'll be in on this?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nSAM\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nLeo and Sam walk out through different doors while the President sits with\nhis hack to\nthe camera.

We cut back to Stanley, rolling up his\nsleeve.\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah, I don't think you did.\n\nJOSH\nStanley, I got home from the thing, I made a drink, I sat down, I pushed\nthe magazine\naside to use as a coaster, and I missed the coaster.\n\nWe cut to the flashback again. Josh is looking at his bloody hands. We go\nback to the\nmeeting room.\n\nSTANLEY\nYou missed the coaster with quite a bit of force.\n\nJOSH\nI work out when I can.\n\nSTANLEY\nI swear I am completely unimpressed with clever answers.\n\nJOSH\nAnd I was so hoping we'd have a second day.\n\nSTANLEY\n[smiles] You're in nine kinds of pain.

HAUSSMANN\nYes.\n\nDAVID\nHe was an art collector, mostly of minor impressionists that nobody really\ncared that\nmuch about. He was a French Jew.\n\nC.J.\nAnd the Vichy Laws stripped him of his property?\n\nDAVID\n[nods] Yeah.\n\nC.J.\nWell, best as we can tell, the Nazis sold the painting to a Swiss dealer\nsometime after\nyour grandfather perished at Auschwitz. It made its way to the Musee d'Orsee,\nand then to\nthe National Gallery, where the President spotted it. We've contacted the\nFrench...\n\nBERNARD\n[interrupting] Who probably surrendered.\n\nC.J.\n...who wanted to settle this matter amicably.\n\nMrs. Haussmann nods.\n\nC.J.\nWe'd like you to have our sincere apology, as well as, of course, the painting\nback.\n\nMRS.

Would you explain to your mother that I had the\npainting\nappraised, and it's worth about $400,000 now. You should also tell her that,\nif she\nlikes, we'd be honored to continue hanging the painting, and the longer we\ndo, the\nhigher it will appreciate.\n\nMRS.

It was perfectly benign to anyone who doesn't take shoes\nthat seriously.\nJust tell her that I love her and that I'm sorry and I'll take her shoe\nshopping.\n\nJOSH\nWhy don't you tell her?\n\nLEO\nIf someone else tells her it seems like I was thoughtful enough to mention\nit. If I tell her\nit just makes me seem feminine.\n\nJOSH\nYou don't think the shoe shopping's gonna take care of that?\n\nLEO\nLet's call the insurance company and see how much water damage was done in\nthe mural room.\n\nJOSH\nYou don't need to wave a stick, Leo.

In the last thirty years,\nthe purchasing\npower of the minimum wage has gone down 30%, while you know how much the\nstock market has\ngone up?\n\nANN\nA hundred and fifteen percent. Toby, small businesses will fold or produce\nless because they\ncan't afford to pay a federally mandated wage!

You're\ngonna sandbag the thing in committee. You've shown us your whole hand.

The press doesn't have access to it.\n\nC.J.\nSo they don't know what questions we're asking?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nAre you sure?\n\nSAM\nThe only way they'd know what questions were being asked is if they were\nactually called\nby one of the pollsters and...

They sample 800 respondents...\n\nC.J.\nWould the two of you stop being amazed by the mathematics!\n\nSAM\nAll right, I'd pass it off.

[indicates a woman behind him] Oh,\nmy aide,\nCaprice.\n\nCAPRICE\n[shakes Leo's hand] How do you do?\n\nLEO\nLeo McGarry.\n\nJOSH\nGood to see you, ambassador.\n\nMARBURY\nGod bless you, Josh. The prayers of millions were answered.\n\nJOSH\n[a little stunned] Thank you, sir.\n\nMARBURY\nI have come.\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nMARBURY\nI am Lord John Marbury, along with my aide, Caprice, and I am hereby presenting\nmy\ncredentials in the fervent hope...\n\nLEO\nJohn, we do that later with the President.\n\nMARBURY\nExcellent!

As a matter of fact, the\ntiming of your\narrival couldn't be better.\n\nMARBURY\nHow so?\n\nJOSH\nLeo's trying to convince the president to give the NMD more time.\n\nLEO\nAnd you're an expert in the field. And I hope I can count on your support.\n\nMARBURY\nYou may hope for it but you'll not have it.\n\nLEO\nWhy not?\n\nMARBURY\nBecause the NMD is an absurdly wasteful military boondoggle that will never\nproduce\na working missile. It violates any number of elements of the ABM treaty. And\nany\nargument you make in its defense will surely be moronic.\n\nJOSH\nAh, detente.\n\nMARBURY\nI'm sorry, Gerald.\n\nLEO\nWe're going to have this out.\n\nMARBURY\nExcellent.\n\nLEO\nLet's go get you knighted or whatever the hell it is we do.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

It's good.\n\nC.J.\nThat's what everybody's saying.\n\nCOREY\nWell, I appreciate that.\n\nC.J.\n[laughs] So, you know, this is about the Will Rogers dinner.\n\nCOREY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nThey're going to ask you to host and obviously the President's going to be\nthere.\n[beat] We appreciate the support.\n\nCOREY\nYou want me to say no.\n\nC.J.\nWe think the press'll go back two years and bring up the whole...\n\nCOREY\nLet'em.\n\nC.J.\nI don't want to.

I've done\ncommercials for you.\nAnd I voted for you. Because of something I never did wrong two years ago,\nyou don't want\nto be on the dais with me?\n\nC.J.\nThat's not...\n\nCOREY\nIt takes a special kind of arrogance not to think that that's not\ndisrespectful.\n\nThe waitress puts their drinks on the table.\n\nCOREY\nThanks, Alicia. [to C.J.] Make your case. I've got to be funny in a while.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I suppose it was possible I was drunk.\n\nJOSH\nReasonable bet.\n\nBARTLET\nListen, I gotta go a few blocks across town to give an address on global\nwarming and the\nfuture of our planet. That's not something you're interested in, right?\n\nMARBURY\nGood God, no.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. Well, stay here and fight with Leo about something. We'll get you some\ndinner.\nI'll be back in an hour. We'll do your thing and then enjoy your reception.\n\nMARBURY\nExcellent.\n\nLEO\nIndeed.\n\nCHARLIE\nHere we go.\n\nLeo, Bartlet and Charlie leave.\n\nMARBURY\nAn hour, did he say?\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nMARBURY\nI'll need some amusement.\n\nDONNA\n[enters] Good evening, your lordship.\n\nMARBURY\nExcellent.\n\nCUT TO INT.

I'm in a room full of rich Democrats in an election year. What\nyou\nthought I was going to talk about airline food?\n\nC.J.\nIt was a political fundraiser in the heat of a national campaign. You weren't\ndoing a\n2 a.m. set at Catch a Rising Star.\n\nCOREY\n[insulted] You know how many years it's been since I worked Catch a Rising\nStar?\n\nC.J.\nYou made the joke, and inoffensive as you think it may have been, there was\nenormous\npressure on the candidate to disavow your remarks and he did not.\n\nCOREY\nAnd I'm supposed to be...\n\nC.J.\nCorey...\n\nCOREY\nAnd I'm supposed to feel good about that? That he didn't disavow me? That\nI wasn't\ndisavowed?\n\nC.J.\nWe were courting law enforcement, Corey. Don't be naive.\n\nCOREY\nYou were also courting the black vote, C.J.. I'm not naive.\n\nC.J.\nWhat did you expect us to do?\n\nCOREY\nI expected that when I was called, in any number of places, a Hollywood\nsleaze, that\nyou might have said a few words, maybe, on my behalf. I expected that you\nwere going\nto say, \"We in the Bartlet campaign do not believe Cornelius Sykes is a\nHollywood sleaze.\nWe believe he's a world class humorist and millions of Americans agree. We\nbelieve his\nhumor can be disconcerting to some but those who are making noise right now\nare feigning\ntheir concern in an effort to frighten white men.\" But what you said was,\n\"He didn't\nlaugh at the joke.\"\n\nC.J.\nCorey...\n\nCOREY\nHe did laugh at the joke.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nCOREY\nHe laughed at the joke, C.J.. I've been doing this for 20 years. You don't\nthink I'd\nknow if I had him? I killed that night. That was a very big deal for me. To\nplay in\nfront of that audience? To get that man to laugh? And the next day my parents\nread in\nthe paper that I am Hollywood sleaze. But that's okay cause the candidate\ndidn't think\nit was funny.\n\nC.J.\n[looking uncomfortable] I understand.\n\nCOREY\nI don't want to cause any trouble for the President. You knew that when you\nwalked in\nhere. I'll pass on the dinner. I'll tell'em it's cause I can't get out of\na booking.\nBut the president laughed at the joke, C.J.. I killed that night.\n\nC.J.\n[smiling] You did. Okay, I gotta go.\n\nCOREY\nI'll see you next time.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

George the first was the great-nephew of Charles the first,\nwho\nwas the son of James the first, and James' mother was Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nDONNA\nAnd are you and Caprice an item?\n\nMARBURY\nWhy, no.\n\nCHARLIE\n[walking up between them] Mr. Ambassador?\n\nMARBURY\nIs he back?\n\nCHARLIE\nHe's back, but he's receiving credentials from Her Excellency Renee Ernesto\nof Argentina\nand asked for your patience.\n\nMARBURY\nThen my patience he shall have!\n\nSam walks by and catches up with C.J., who has just walked in, still in her\nhat and coat.\n\nSAM\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nYou just get back?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nYou heard what happened?\n\nC.J.\nYeah. Here's what it is: the President has always spoken out on moderate\ngroups not\ntaking responsibility for extremism, and he isn't going to stop at the\nenvironmental\nlobby. Friends are honest with each other. [as Sam stops walking] Sam?\n\nSAM\nHave you spoken to Toby?\n\nC.J.\nWhen?\n\nSAM\nSince after the speech tonight\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nThey're setting up for the reception?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I'm all for\nprocurement.\n\nTOBY\nI'm talking about Abrams' tax and Apache helicopters, which we know work.\n\nLEO\nAn Apache helicopter will not stop a Shahab3 longrange stiletto, or a North\nKorean ICBM.\n\nSam passes by outside.\n\nTOBY\nWell so far neither can anything else. [calling outside] Hey, Sam?\n\nLEO\nI'm going back in there.\n\nToby walks out of office and up to Sam.\n\nTOBY\nHave you been getting questions?\n\nSAM\nI'm sorry?\n\nTOBY\nHave you been getting questions?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nFrom the press, or...?\n\nSAM\nThe press'll be tomorrow.\n\nTOBY\nSo who's asking?\n\nSAM\nThe chairman of the GDC. Four Congressmen. The Secretary of the Interior. Who'd\nyou\nthink would be talking to me?\n\nTOBY\nThen what did you...?\n\nSAM\nI said, \"Sometimes friends have to be honest with each other.\" I said exactly\nwhat you\ntold me to say, which, coincidentally, is exactly C.J. told me to say,\nwhich is\nremarkable when you consider that C.J. was in New York during the event and\ndidn't\nspeak to you afterward. I mean, it's almost as if there were people who knew\nit was\ngoing to happen.\n\nTOBY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nGet away from me.\n\nSam walks out of office and to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. He stands for a moment,\nthen the\ndoor opens and Charlie walks out.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nIs it possible I could get in for just a minute?\n\nToby appears in the hallway looking in. He shakes his head at Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe's pretty tight right now. I don't think I can get you in.\n\nSam looks over his shoulder and spots Toby, who walks away. Sam gives Charlie\na betrayed\nlook, then leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT\nMusic is playing. Donna and Marbury are chatting.\n\nMARBURY\nOh, well, yes. Oh, certainly. There's uh, Edward, Earl of Ulster. He's the\nson of\nRichard, Duke of Gloucester, who's the son of Henry, Duke of Gloucester.\n\nDONNA\nEdward, Earl of Ulster?\n\nMARBURY\nYes.\n\nDONNA\nDo you think he'd like me?\n\nMARBURY\nDo you date younger men?\n\nDONNA\nSure. How old is he?\n\nMARBURY\nFive.\n\nDONNA\nOkay, well let's stick a pin in that for a moment and move on.\n\nLeo walks up.\n\nLEO\nHello.\n\nDONNA\nHello.\n\nLEO\nAm I interrupting?\n\nMARBURY\nNot at all.\n\nDONNA\nAmbassador Marbury was just telling me about how royal men are schooled in\nthe ways of\ncourtship. King George III, for example, sailed his bride up the river Thames\nto music\nthat was specially composed.\n\nLEO\nYeah. That was just a few years before we opened up a big can of whoopass\non him at\nYorktown.\n\nMARBURY\nLeo, I- [as Donna slips away]\n\nLEO\nHow can you look at North Korea, which 24 months ago fired a Taepodong\nmissile...?\n\nMARBURY\nUh, which failed...\n\nLEO\nAnd with some modifications it'll be able to reach Alaska.\n\nMARBURY\nWell I don't live in Alaska, I live in England, which by the way is not\nprotected by\nthe shield. Not that anywhere else is at the moment, either. You've also\nforgotten that\nwe're both signatories to the '72 ABM treaty, which the shield is in clear\nviolation.\nYou've forgotten that it will compel China to strengthen their nuclear\narsenal. You've\nforgotten that the European allies have strong reservations about the\nshield. And you've\nforgotten that it doesn't work.\n\nLEO\nYou know what I haven't forgotten?\n\nMARBURY\nWhat?\n\nLEO\nThat we opened up a big can of whoopass on you at Yorktown!\n\nMARBURY\nAll right.\n\nCHARLIE\n[coming up to them] Leo?\n\nLEO\nExcuse me.\n\nMARBURY\nExcuse me.\n\nDONNA\n[passing by Charlie] I'm going to correspond with Edward, Earl of Ulster,\nonce he\nlearns how to read and write.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT\nSam is having a drink. Alice, the waitress, comes up.\n\nALICE\nHere you go.\n\nTOBY\nNo, no, Alice. I got it.\n\nSAM\nIt's all right.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I got it.\n\nALICE\nYou want a beer?\n\nTOBY\nYeah. Thanks.\n\nHe hands her money, and she leaves.\n\nTOBY\nYou don't ever go into the Oval Office mad.\n\nSAM\nLook...\n\nTOBY\nNo, no, no. No, Sam. You don't ever go in there mad\n\nSAM\nI think the President's remarks were ill advised, to say the least.\n\nTOBY\nYou're wrong.\n\nSAM\nThe drop-in's the story now, Toby, not the energy package.\n\nTOBY\nThe energy package doesn't need to be a story; it's going to be a law.\n\nSAM\nYou don't think we're going to need the environmental lobby?\n\nTOBY\nI think we need them, I just don't think we're going to lose them.\n\nSAM\nAnd I think you're tragically misguided.\n\nTOBY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nMany, if not most, environmentalists are absolutists who will use this insult\nto pull\ntheir support under cover we cut a deal in Detroit.\n\nTOBY\nWell then they can grow up, Sam. Use this insult? They just got the energy\npackage they\nwanted, they just got the president at their dinner, and they should shut up!\n\nSAM\nWell you should explain it to them just that way, Toby, cause they're really\npretty\nreceptive to that argument.\n\nTOBY\nWhen they look down the ballot and see the alternatives, they get receptive\nin a hurry.\n\nSAM\nWas there anything else, or can I sit here now?\n\nTOBY\n[standing to leave] You can sit here. I'll see you tomorrow.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nSam, I'm looking at opposition polling that scares the hell out of me. I'm\nlooking at\ninternal numbers that change by the hour. I'm listening to economists who\ntell me\nthere's weather...\n\nSAM\nYou left me out.\n\nTOBY\n[sighing] Yeah.\n\nSAM\nYou think I'm the reason you got beat on the Leadership Breakfast?\n\nTOBY\nI got creamed, Sam.\n\nSAM\nYou think I'm the reason?\n\nTOBY\nI don't want that discussion.\n\nSAM\nThen what are you doing here talking to me? Now you want the discussion. You\nand the\npresident may think they deserved it, but this cynicism of attacking your\nfriends for\npolitical protection offends them and it offends me. It offends you, and\nthere's really\nnothing I can do to make you feel better about that.\n\nTOBY\nWe can't govern if we don't win.\n\nSAM\nYou should've talked to me about the numbers more.\n\nTOBY\nAnyway. I have this beer...\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nI was just gonna sit down and drink it.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nI mean, we don't have to talk or anything.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nToby and Sam sit in silence.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nBartlet walks in and speaks to Leo and Josh, who are waiting for him.\n\nBARTLET\nThat was Chairwoman Shelly Lubis I just got off the phone with. Before that\nwas a\nconference call with Jamie Schwartz of the Environmental Defense Fund,\nBryce Davis\nof the Sierra Club, and three Democratic Congressman from the Subcommittee\non Energy\nand the Environment. The number of different words they had for \"manipulative,\"\n\nLeo, there's no way they didn't have a thesaurus open in front of them. Bryce\nDavis\nsaid if I keep this up, he's going to encourage Seth Gillette in a thirdparty\nbid.\n\nLEO\nWhat'd you say?\n\nBARTLET\nI said for fifty bucks and a ride to the airport, Gillette could have the\njob right now.\n\nLEO\nWhat'd you say?\n\nBARTLET\nI politely reminded him that it's probably not a good idea to threaten the\npresident.\n[yelling] Nancy! [to Leo] I want to know when you're pushing me towards the\nmissile\nshield it's not because you want me to look strong on defense.\n\nNANCY\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nWould you tell Charlie I'm ready?\n\nNANCY\nYes, sir.\n\nLEO\nI'm not. I'm pushing you to the missile defense shield cause I think it\nworks.\n\nBARTLET\nBased on what?\n\nLEO\nConfidence. And the understanding that there's been a time in the evolution\nof everything\nthat works when it didn't work.\n\nJOSH\nYou know, can I say this? Why don't we just give the sixty billion dollars\nto North Korea\nin exchange for not bombing us?\n\nBARTLET\nIt's almost hard to believe that you're not on the National Security Council.\n\nJOSH\nI know. I feel like they're missing an important voice.\n\nThe door opens. Lord Marbury enters with entourage.\n\nMARBURY\nGood evening!\n\nBARTLET\nJohn! Let me explain why you've been waiting. I have to see people in the\norder they\narrive, and you got beat by Argentina.\n\nMARBURY\nOh, uhh... Well, yes.\n\nBARTLET\nYou also lost out on preferred seating for the State of the Union.\n\nMARBURY\nI'm required to attend the State of the Union?\n\nBARTLET\nYes!\n\nMARBURY\nThen attend it I shall.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, Tom?\n\nTOM\nMr. President, it is with pleasure I present His Excellency, Lord John\nMarbury of\nGreat Britain, and by request of the Secretary of State, ask that you accept\nhis\ncredentials from Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, as Great Britain's\nAmbassador\nto the United States.\n\nBartlet takes the folder from Marbury.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere are you on the missile shield?\n\nMARBURY\nWell, I think it's dangerous, illegal... fiscally irresponsible,\ntechnologically unsound,\nand a threat to all people everywhere.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nI think the world invented a nuclear weapon. I think the world owes it to\nitself to see\nif it can't invent something that would make it irrelevant.\n\nMARBURY\nWell, that's the right sentiment, certainly a credible one from a man who's\nfought in a\nwar. You think you can make it stop? Well, you can't. We build a shield,\nand somebody\nwill build a better missile.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, it's a discussion for serious men. They say a statesman is a politician\nwho's\nbeen dead for fifteen years. I'd like us to be statesmen while we're still\nalive.\nLord Marbury, I accept your letter of credence from Queen Elizabeth, and,\nby affixing\nmy signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be Ambassador Extraordinary\nand\nPlenipotentiary.\n\nThey shake hands.\n\nMARBURY\nWell, thank you, sir.\n\nMarbury turns and shakes hands with Leo.\n\nLEO\nCongratulations.\n\nMARBURY\nGod Bless America.\n\nLEO\nGod Save the Queen.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go.\n\nThe photographers snap pictures of Bartlet and Marbury as they pose.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

The only way it says that at all is if\nyou remove some\nwords from it.\n\nSHALLICK\nOh, look. Will you...?\n\nTOBY\nIt says a well-regulated militia, being necessary for the security of the\nfree state...\nthe government shall not infringe. The words regulated and militia are in\nthe first sentence.\nI don't think the Framer's were thinking of three guys in a Dodge Durango.\n\nSHALLICK\nWell, you don't really know what the Framers were thinking, do you?\n\nTOBY\nNo. But I do know that if you combine the populations of Great Britain,\nFrance, Germany,\nJapan, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Australia you've got a population\nroughly the size\nof the United States. We had 32,000 gun deaths last year and they had 112. Do\nyou think it's\nbecause Americans are more homicidal by nature?

So, what was your concern\nwith the language?\n\nABBEY\nThe draft said, \"Our commitment to the full benefits promised to Americas\ngreatest generation\nis absolute.\" I was there when you wrote that.\n\nTOBY\nAnd our commitment is still absolute. We're open to new ideas and that's\nwhat it said.\n\nABBEY\nOh, please...\n\nTOBY\nBelieve me, we gave Republicans plenty to be pissed about... the surplus,\nmissile defense,\ncapital gains.

What was it?\n\nMrs. Landingham hands Charlie her bag and hangs up her coat.\n\nCHARLIE\nMrs. Bartlet wrote the check to a woman she read about in the paper who's\nnow living in\na battered women's shelter. You know why the woman never cashed the check?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nBecause it was from the First Lady and she had it framed instead?\n\nShe takes back the bag and walks behind her desk.\n\nCHARLIE\nYep. That was the mystery.\n\nShe glances at an appointment book on her desk.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nIt's a good one. Does the President know he has breakfast with Josh and Sam?\n\nCHARLIE\nHe's on his way.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nGood.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt was a good mystery.

HALLWAY - DAY\nJosh and Sam walk down the hallway.\n\nJOSH\nCan I tell you something strange?\n\nSAM\nSure.\n\nJOSH\n[smirking] All last night at the phone banks, Donna was telling me I should\nask Joey\nLucas out.\n\nSAM\nYou should. [smiles]\n\nJOSH\nFine. But... that aside. What do you make about Donna being the one pushing...\n\nThey enter a PRIVATE DINING ROOM. A table with three place settings sits\ninside.\n\nSAM\nI don't think anything.\n\nJOSH\nYou wouldn't think she'd be jealous?\n\nSAM\nShe goes out with guys. Are you jealous?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nSAM\nSee.\n\nJOSH\n[quickly] I don't get jealous.\n\nSAM\nSo?\n\nJOSH\nI don't like it and usually do everything within my considerable capabilities\nto\nsabotage it.\n\nThey sit down at the table.\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nJOSH\n[takes a deep breath] Which is why its curious that Donna would do nothing\nto discourage\nand in fact everything to do encourage a date with Joey Lucas... who, quite\nfrankly,\n[his voice goes sky high] is a very attractive woman!\n\nSam stares at him.\n\nSAM\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nYou know your voice just got really high at the end of that.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, sorry.\n\nBartlet enters carrying his coffee.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nThey stand.\n\nSAM\nGood morning, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks for having breakfast with me.\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you order something?\n\nSAM\nNo sir, we were waiting for you.\n\nBARTLET\n[loudly] Billy!

I inherited the\nwar on drugs\nfrom a President, who inherited it from a President, who inherited it from\na President\nbefore that. I'm not a hundred percent sure who we're fighting but I'm sure\nwe're not\nwinning. Ten years ago we spent $5 billion fighting drugs and we did such\na good job that\nlast year we spent $16 billion. Sixty percent of Federal prisoners are in\njail on drug\ncharges as opposed to two and a half percent in jail for violent crime. We\nimprison a\nhigher percentage of our citizens than Russia did under Communism and South\nAfrica under\nApartheid. Somewhere between fifty and eighty-five percent of our prison\npopulation has a\ndrug or alcohol abuse problem. We've tried \"just say no.\" I don't think it's\ngoing to\nwork. [looks at his watch] I'm mentioning this because I'd like you to give\nme any\nthoughts you might have on the subject.\n\nHe gets up.

You're\na Junior\nSenator from North Dakota and you don't get script approval [laughs] on the\nState of the\nUnion!\n\nGILLETTE\nWhatever language you may have couched it in was not an insignificant change.\n\nTOBY\nSeth...\n\nGILLETTE\nYou started off with \"We will not cut Social Security\"... period, wound up\nwith \"We are\nannouncing the formation of a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission to study\nnew options with\nregard to Social Security.\"\n\nTOBY\nWhat exactly is the danger of studying new options?\n\nGILLETTE\nWhat's the danger in the White House getting behind my reform bill?\n\nTOBY\nDiverting General Revenue into the trust fund is not reform.\n\nGILLETTE\nIt's the only Social Security reform bill supported by any Senate Democrats.\n\nTOBY\nHow many votes did you get for it last year?\n\nGILLETTE\nIf the White House...\n\nTOBY\nEighteen.\n\nGILLETTE\nIf the White House...\n\nTOBY\n82 U.S. Senators think your reform bill sucks. So unless you have a plan\nfor picking up\na majority, I don't know what's so wrong with saying we're open to hearing\nnew ideas?\n\nGILLETTE\nAnd compromise essential Democratic Party principles to cut a Social Security\ndeal with\nthe Republicans?\n\nTOBY\nIt's simply not what we're doing.\n\nGILLETTE\n[emphatically] If your commission recommends raising the retirement age one\nday...\nreducing benefits one dollar... reducing quotas. If your commission recommends\npartial\nprivatization of Social Security...\n\nTOBY\n[smiles] Are there cameras on someplace?\n\nGILLETTE\n...I will condemn it the act of a group intent on destroying Social\nSecurity...\n\nTOBY\n...and ruling the galaxy.\n\nGILLETTE\nOh, you think this is a joke? You think I won't publicly condemn a member\nof my party?\n\nToby stares at him.\n\nTOBY\nThe President is not a member of your party. He is the leader of your\nparty. And if you\nthink demonizing people who are trying to govern responsibly is the way to\nprotect our\nliberal base, then speaking as a liberal... go to bed, would you please!\n\nGILLETTE\nYou're running to the right on the environment.\n\nTOBY\nWe admonished environmental terrorism.\n\nGILLETTE\nPlease!\n\nTOBY\nYou in favor of it?\n\nGILETTE\nIt was a cheap shot and you lost a lot of friends that night.\n\nTOBY\nWe made more than we lost.\n\nGILLETTE\nThen you go on TV this morning with this ridiculous defense of a cop who\nkicked the crap\nout of a black kid cause you guys don't want to admit you screwed up on the\nvetting and\nhe never should've been invited in the first place. [counts on his fingers]\nSeniors...\nEnvironmentalists... African Americans. You tell me which you think has a\ngreater chance\nof happening, my reform bill getting passed or the President getting reelected\nwithout\nthe three groups I just mentioned?\n\nTOBY\nYou just named three groups that'll never desert the President.\n\nGILLETTE\nNot unless I run as a third-party candidate, no. Oh! Those eighteen votes\nare looking a\nlittle bigger now aren't they you patronizing son-of-a-bitch!\n\nGillette drops his fork on the table loudly and looks around angrily. Toby\nshakes his\nhead and smiles.\n\nTOBY\nI was just thinking about this cartoon I once saw. A bunch of tiny fish are\nswimming\nthrough the leaves of the plant but then one of the fish realizes it's not\na plant,\nit's the tentacles of a predator. And the fish says, \"with friends like this,\nwho needs\nanemones?\"\n\nGillette looks confused. Toby signs the check.\n\nTOBY\nCome at us from the left, I'm gonna own your ass.\n\nToby grabs his paper and coat and leaves. Gillette watches him go.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Bartlet stands across the table from Toby and Sam.\n\nSAM\nWait, Toby...\n\nTOBY\n[loudly] Hang on a second Sam, you give into terrorist demands and that's\nthe ballgame!\n\nSAM\nI understand the principle but there are real lives at stake!\n\nTOBY\nAh, it's real easy to stick to principles when nothing's at stake Sam!\n\nSAM\n[to Bartlet] Well sir, lets argue principles when these five guys get home.\n\nBARTLET\nJuan Aguilar runs one of the largest drug cartels in the world.\n\nSAM\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nHe has produced $15 billion worth of cocaine in two years.\n\nDonna comes in and stands next to Josh.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's murdered or ordered the murder of eight Supreme Court justices, a\npro-extradition\nPrime Minister and three Federal police officers in Bogot.. And from his\nprison cell I\nguarantee you he orchestrated the kidnapping of five U.S. DEA agents and\nthe killing of\ntheir rescuers!\n\nTOBY\nI believe he did it as well Mr. President, which is all then evidence you\nneed that it\ncouldn't matter less whether Juan Aguilar is in prison, or not!\n\nBARTLET\nI'm not letting him out. [slams shut his folder] I'll share a cell with him\nbefore I let\nhim out. I want military options!\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nThey all rise as Bartlet leaves.\n\nMILITARY ADVISOR\nYes, sir.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, sir.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nJosh follows out to the HALLWAY as the room starts to clear.\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nDONNA\nJoey says it's probably just another hour.\n\nJOSH\nShe'll bring me the numbers here?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJosh sighs as they walk to the LOBBY.\n\nDONNA\nJosh, how is this not a no-brainer?\n\nJOSH\nColumbia?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nYou say get'em home?\n\nDONNA\nOf course I say get'em home. Who doesn't say get'em home? That should be\nthe person who\nhas to make the phone calls to the families.\n\nThey face each other in the doorway of Josh's office.\n\nJOSH\nAnd who calls the families of the nine commandos who just died trying to\nsave five guys\nit turns out we could've freed six hours ago.\n\nDONNA\nThat's not a good enough reason.\n\nJOSH\nThe good enough reason is you give in to terrorists it gives them a pretty\ngood incentive\nto keep terrorizing.\n\nDONNA\nNot negotiating with them hasn't given them much of a disincentive.\n\nJOSH\nHow do you know?\n\nDONNA\nPlease...\n\nJOSH\nYou don't think they're going to kidnap five more people tomorrow morning\nand demand\ntwelve months of free cable?\n\nDONNA\nSo you give them free cable.\n\nJOSH\nHow about the keys to the Situation Room?\n\nDONNA\n[unsure] You draw a line.\n\nJOSH\nWhere?

SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT\nMickey, Leo and military advisors sit around the table. Bartlet stands at\nthe head.\n\nBARTLET\nDo we know where they are?\n\nMICKEY\nThey were moved about sixty miles into the jungle at Villa Cerreno.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat would it take to get them back?\n\nMICKEY\nAlive?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLeo looks at Mickey. Mickey looks at the military advisors uneasily.\n\nMICKEY\nMr. President, uh...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat would it take to wipe them out?\n\nJACK\nAffronte?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. What would it take?\n\nMICKEY\nMr. President, for the kind of victory Americans are used to, for the kind\nof victory\nAmericans demand from a war you need a ten to one ratio.\n\nBartlet looks at Leo who nods.\n\nMICKEY\nIt was only after we built up a 10:1 ratio in the Gulf we felt comfortable\nmaking a move.\nThe Fronte has 20,000 well-armed, well-trained soldiers, each of whom has\na financial\nstake in heroin and cocaine. We'd need to put 200 to 300,000 men into a\njungle war.\nAnd I think we'd lose as many as half.\n\nBARTLET\n[surprised] Half?\n\nMICKEY\nYes, sir.\n\nBartlet looks down at the table and shakes his head.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Leo] You've really got to ask yourself what's the point in being a Super\nPower\nanymore.\n\nThey rise as Bartlet leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nAbbey's two aides carry her suitcase to the door. Abbey enters carrying a\nsweater.\n\nABBEY\nI wanted to bring that book for the Governor...\n\nCARRIE\nThe Truman biography?\n\nABBEY\nYeah.\n\nShe hands Carrie a sweater.\n\nABBEY\nYou got a sweater for the plane?\n\nCARRIE\nYes, Ma'am.\n\nABBEY\nAnd you guys should both take sweaters.\n\nBARTLET\n[enters] And then there's the repack!\n\nAbbey looks at him.\n\nCARRIE\nGood morning, Mr. President.\n\nHe glances at the suitcase.\n\nBARTLET\nFirst there's the preliminary, or the dry run. Then there's the actual\npacking. [joking]\nAbbey, you're just going away for two days, right?\n\nABBEY\n[to aides] Guys...\n\nThe aides leave, closing the door behind them.\n\nBARTLET\n[seriously] Right?\n\nABBEY\nWhat happened?\n\nBARTLET\nIt was an ambush.\n\nABBEY\nOh God... [sinks into a chair]\n\nBARTLET\nA guy with a shoulder thing shot down a Blackhawk. Everybody's dead. [sits\nfacing her]\nNine guys. Meanwhile, they've moved the hostages 60 miles into the jungle\nwhere we'd need\na pair of tweezers to get them out.\n\nABBEY\n[concerned] Do you want me to stay?\n\nBARTLET\n[shakes head] No.\n\nABBEY\nI can stay.\n\nBARTLET\nNo. I didn't make the decision to run again. I wouldn't do that without\ntalking to you\nfirst.\n\nABBEY\n[sighs] Oh, we don't need to talk about that now. [gets up and starts pacing]\n\nBARTLET\nWhen, Abbey?\n\nABBEY\nJed!\n\nBARTLET\nI didn't make the decision to run again!\n\nABBEY\nYes, you did! [faces him angrily] If we're gonna talk about this, let's talk\nabout this.\nThe moves over the last few weeks... the changes in last night's speech. This\nwhole place\nis in reelection mode.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's what we do, Abbey. We run for things! From the day a Congressman is\nsworn in he's\ngot to raise $10,000 a week to get reelected! A President gets to govern\nfor eighteen\nmonths. We try to get people to vote for us and in the process we hope the\npeople force\nus to do good things.\n\nABBEY\n[hurt] We had a deal!\n\nBARTLET\n[angry] Yes, we had a deal.\n\nABBEY\nYes, Jed.\n\nShe walks back over and sits across from him. She leans in to eye level.\n\nABBEY\nLook at me!\n\nHe reluctantly looks at her.\n\nABBEY\n[tearfully] Do you get that you have M.S.?\n\nBARTLET\n[scornfully] Abbey...\n\nABBEY\nDo you get that your own immune system is shredding your brain? And I can't\ntell you why.\n[tearfully] Do you have any idea how good a doctor I am and that I can't\ntell you why?\n\nBARTLET\nI've had one episode in two years.\n\nABBEY\n[tearfully] Yes, but relapsing-remitting M.S. can turn into\nsecondary-progressive M.S.\noftentimes ten years after the initial diagnosis which is exactly where\nwe'll be in two\nyears! Do you know what that's going to look like when it happens?\n\nHe looks away.\n\nBARTLET\n[quietly] I know what it's going to...\n\nABBEY\nFatigue... an inability to get through the day...\n\nBARTLET\nLook...\n\nABBEY\n...memory lapses... loss of cognitive function... failure to reason... failure\nto think\nclearly. And I can't tell you if it's going to happen. I don't know if it's\ngoing to get\nbetter I don't know if it's going to get worse. But we had a deal. And that\ndeal is how\nyou justified keeping it a secret from the world. It's how you justified it\nto God.\n[hurt] It's how you justified it to me.\n\nHe looks up at her. Carrie knocks on the door and sticks her head in.\n\nCARRIE\nMrs. Bartlet.\n\nABBEY\n[to Carrie] Yeah.\n\nCarrie leaves.\n\nABBEY\nYou sure you don't want me to stay?\n\nHe avoids looking at her.\n\nBARTLET\n[quietly] Yeah.\n\nABBEY\n[quietly] Okay.\n\nAbbey rises and heads for the door.\n\nBARTLET\nHave a good trip.\n\nShe turns back to him as he rises.\n\nBARTLET\nCall me when you get there.\n\nABBEY\nI will.\n\nHe gives her a long look.\n\nBARTLET\nI love you.\n\nABBEY\nI love you too.\n\nAbbey quietly leaves. Bartlet sits back down and thinks.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nJosh dejectedly leans over the polling results on his desk. Donna stands\nnext to him.\nJoey sits across the desk. Kenny stands next to her.\n\nJOSH\nSon of a bitch.\n\nDONNA\nThat's okay.\n\nJOSH\nA five day waiting period, that's all. A person can't wait five days to buy\na gun?\nIf someone needs a gun right now, right this second, isn't that something\nthe public\nshould be concerned about?\n\nDONNA\nOn the other hand taking the feelings of gun owners into account, if you've\ngot to shoot\nsomebody it probably isn't something that can wait.\n\nJosh looks at the numbers.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDonna looks at her watch.\n\nDONNA\nMind if I take off?\n\nJOSH\nWhat time is it?\n\nDONNA\n2 a.m.\n\nHe looks at his watch.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. We'll call it a full day. But come in early in the morning.\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nDonna heads for the door. Joey glances at Josh as he watches her go.\n\nJOSH\nYou all right getting home?\n\nDONNA\nYeah. [to Joey and Kenny] Good night, guys.\n\nKENNY\nGood night.\n\nJosh watches Donna leave. Joey smiles at his distracted look.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThey're just preliminary numbers.\n\nJosh sits down with a sigh and puts his feet on his desk.\n\nJOSH\nThey're not gonna change.\n\nJOEY\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nFive day waiting period...\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nIt tested well nationwide.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\n58%.\n\nJOSH\nI didn't need nationwide. I needed those five districts. Now we're gonna\nhave to dial\ndown the gun rhetoric in the Midwest.\n\nJOEY\nWhy not dial it up?\n\nJOSH\nBecause these numbers just told us that...\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nYou don't know what these numbers just told you. I'm an expert. I don't know\nwhat these\nnumbers just told you.\n\nJOSH\nWe know.\n\nJOEY\nReally?\n\nKenny sits next to Joey.\n\nJOSH\nNumbers don't lie.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThey lie all the time. They lie when 72% of Americans say they're tired of\na sex scandal,\nwhile all the while, newspaper circulation goes through the roof for anyone\nfeaturing\nthe story. If you polled a hundred Donnas and asked them if they think we\nshould go out,\nyou'd get a high positive response. But, the poll wouldn't tell you it's\nbecause she\nlikes you. And she's knows it's beginning to show and she needs to cover\nherself with\nmisdirection.\n\nJosh stares blankly at Joey.\n\nJOSH\nBelieve me when I tell you that's not true.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nYou say that these numbers mean dial it down. I say they mean dial it up. You\nhaven't\ngotten through. There are people you haven't persuaded yet. These numbers\nmean dial it\nup. Otherwise you're like the French radical watching the crowd run by and\nsaying \"There\ngo my people, I must find out where they are going so I can lead them.\"\n\nJosh sits quietly with a thoughtful look on his face.\n\nJOSH\n[distracted] Yeah.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWe'll go through the rest of the numbers in the morning.\n\nJosh looks at her with a confused smile.\n\nJOSH\n[to Kenny] Ok.\n\nJoey smiles and they leave. Josh sits with a bemused expression.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. PORTICO - NIGHT\nBartlet walks tiredly towards the Oval Office. He passes Charlie who is\nwaiting.\n\nCHARLIE\nGood evening, sir.\n\nCharlie walks with him.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Charlie. You shouldn't be out here without a coat.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm ok.\n\nCharlie stops outside the outer office. Bartlet walks on deep in thought.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President?\n\nBartlet stops and turns.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nCHARLIE\nIs there anything I can do for you?\n\nBARTLET\nNo. Thanks.\n\nBartlet walks on to THE OVAL OFFICE. A Secret Service Agent opens the door\nfor him.\nLeo is waiting inside.\n\nBARTLET\nHey!\n\nLEO\nI checked outside. I thought you'd be having a cigarette.\n\nBartlet walks behind his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nLet me tell you something, Leo... [sits] After heroin and cocaine, tobacco\nis next.\n\nLEO\nGreat. Another criminal empire we can give birth to. There'll be speakeasies\nall over\nChicago where you can get smuggled cartons of Marlboro lights. [sits]\n[quietly] I fought a jungle war. I'm not doing it again. If I could put\nmyself anywhere\nin time it would be the Cabinet room on August 4, 1964, when our ships were\nattacked by\nNorth Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf. I'd say, Mr. President... don't do\nit. You're\nconsidering authorizing a massive commitment of troops and throwing in our\nlot with\ntorturers and panderers. Leaders without principle and soldiers without\nconviction with\nno clear mission, and no end in sight. This war is at home. The casualties\nare in our\nprisons, and not our hospitals. The amount of money the American government\nis spending\nin Columbia is the exact same amount American consumers are spending buying\ndrugs from\nColumbia. We're funding both sides of this war and we'll never win it that\nway.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, I can't possibly reverse our...\n\nLEO\nNo one...\n\nBARTLET\nI can't possibly reverse our position on negotiating...\n\nLEO\nNo one's gonna know. You don't make another phone call, it happens someplace\nelse.\nSantos is gonna be the one to let him out.\n\nBARTLET\nThere were just fourteen people in this room who heard Santos make me the\noffer.\n\nLEO\nThose fourteen people keep bigger secrets than this.\n\nBartlet stands and stares out the window.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know what Truman Capote said was the bad part about living outside the\nlaw?\n\nLEO\nWhat?\n\nBARTLET\nYou no longer have the protection of it. What's to stop me? Two hundred CIA\noperatives...\nBlack Ops. Two hundred guys with no wives, no kids, no parents. [faces Leo]\nI send 200\noperatives down there. Monday morning I read in the paper Juan Aguilar is\ndead. What's\nto stop me?\n\nLEO\n[stands] We lost this one, Mr. President. It was bad intelligence and we\nlost this one.\n\nBARTLET\nIt was the Queen's Rook. That's why I couldn't trade the Bishop. It was over\nsix moves\nago. Arrange for their immediate release.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\n[warning glare] If they so much as experience turbulence on their way out...\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI want to go to Dover later tonight.\n\nLEO\n[nods] Yes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nLeo leaves as Bartlet turns back to look out the window.\n\nCAROL [VO]\nFolks, take your seats, please, the briefing will start now.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: INT.

GRIFFITH\nIs this JerseyGirl asking the question, or JerseyBoyfriend?\n\nMODERATOR\nBoth.\n\n\tWEDNESDAY NIGHT\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nOkay. Well, there's no evidence so far that marijuana has a permanent effect\non the male\nor female reproductive systems. A few studies have suggested that heavy\nmarijuana use may\nhave an effect on male testicular function, but that effect would be\nreversible. So, if\nJerseyBoyfriend is concerned then he should mention it to his doctor.\n\nMODERATOR\nPixelad wants to know if marijuana can cause cancer.\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nNo conclusive study to date has shown that it does. However... and this is\na big\nhowever... cellular, genetic and human studies all suggest that the smoke\nfrom pot\nis a risk factor in acquiring respiratory disease. So, if Pixelad wants to\nbe able\nto walk up a flight of stairs without throwing up, he should put the bong\nback in\nthe closet behind the Allman Brothers albums where it belongs.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

First of all, we need him on the Commission,\nor else labor\nand seniors will be suspicious from the getgo; second, if he's not going to\nbe on the\nCommission, it can't be because he turned us down.\n\nSAM\nSo either we get him on the Commission, or if we don't, we make sure it's\nbecause we\nnever asked him.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nGINGER\n[walks in] Sam?

Does the President\nagree with it?\n\nC.J.\nWrong again, and I will refer you to the Surgeon General's comments. When\nasked if\nmarijuana should be legalized, she said and I'm quoting, \"It's not for me\nto say.\"\nAnd she's right, and it's important that people understand this the Surgeon\nGeneral's\nnot a law-maker, she doesn't set drug policy, the President does, and the\nPresident is\n100% against legalizing drugs including marijuana.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.

GRIFFITH\nWell, they won't. As a doctor, I have an obligation to tell the truth.

Only 23% support it.\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nThe number gets a lot higher than that if you ask people under 30.\n\nJOSH\nWell, that's a shock.

LANDYNGHAM\nHard to imagine why you didn't think the President would enjoy that, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell he would have especially enjoyed the scene where the Prince Myshkin\ncharacter has\na seizure while engaging in an erotic fantasy in a Long Island church.\n\nMRS.

No.\n\nBARTLET\nA helicopter?\n\nELLIE\nNo, the agents drove me.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's because you go to school at Johns Hopkins, right?\n\nELLIE\nDad...\n\nBARTLET\nAnd Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore. I'm asking 'cause Baltimore is a 45-minute\ncar ride\nfrom Washington, D.C. and we hardly see you anymore. So, I thought either\nyou transfered\nto a different medical school, they moved Johns Hopkins, or they moved\nBaltimore.\nAre any of those things true?\n\nELLIE\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. And this is accurate, right? This quote \"My father won't fire the\nSurgeon General.\nHe would never do that.\"\n\nELLIE\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nElanor, when you put your head down, your hair falls in your face, and I\ncan't see your\nface, and I can't hear what you're saying.

I have gotten White House reporters transferred to\nYemen for\napproaching Zoey and Elizabeth. It is the law! [walks away to calm down]\nWell, I'm sure\nbefore you gave the quote you cleared it with the Communications Office. I'm\nsure you\nwent over the exact wording with C.J. Cregg and coordinated with White House\nstrategy\nso that the timing was right in the news cycle. I'm certain you consulted\nthe appropriate\nparty leadership because you're a pretty knowledgeable operative having\nspent so much\ntime with me. Ellie?\n\nELLIE\nDad...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nELLIE\nShe was... she was...\n\nBARTLET\nWHAT?\n\nELLIE\nShe was doing...\n\nBARTLET\nPick your head up!\n\nELLIE\nShe was doing exactly what she is supposed to do! She... I'm sorry. She was\nasked a\nquestion, and she said what she knew to be true. And when you start firing\ndoctors for\nthat, you've crossed the line somewhere.\n\nBARTLET\nThere is politics involved in this, Ellie. And you knew it would make me\nunhappy and\nthat's why you did it and that's cheap.\n\nELLIE\nI didn't do it to make you unhappy, Dad.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, you sure didn't do it to make me happy!\n\nELLIE\nI don't know HOW to make you happy, Dad! For that, you've got to talk to\nZoey or Liz.\n\nSilence ensues.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, let's drop it.\n\nBartlet walks back behind his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nMom gets back first thing in the morning and we're running a movie tonight\nif you want\nto stay over.\n\nELLIE\nI can stay over if you want me to.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, thanks.\n\nBartlet shuffles some papers.

[shoots the ball off the wall]\n\nANDY\nSo you'll forgive some people if they're concerned that one of the options\nyou're\ngoing to explore is raising the retirement age.\n\nTOBY\nHey, Andy, people are living decades longer than anyone at this rate in 1935!\n\nANDY\nSo you are considering it!\n\nTOBY\nWe want to consider everything, but we can't consider anything, unless...\n\nANDY\nWhy does this have to happen in secret?\n\nTOBY\nBecause it's the only way it's gonna happen! Because you can't solve Social\nSecurity and\nask people to run for election at the same time! So why not give politicians\nsome cloud\ncover and let them be lawmakers for a while? Fifteen people in a room with\nthe door\nclosed; seven democrats, seven republicans, and the President of the United\nStates, who\nwill not have a vote, and they walk out of that room, and with one voice\nthey make a\nrecommendation to Congress and the American people! And nobody knows who\nwas where!\n[sighs] The only way this is going to happen is in secret. And they only\nway it's going\nto happen is if all the sides are confident in their representation. Otherwise\nit's dead,\nand so I need Seth Gillette on the commission, but I can't ask him, 'cause\nif he says no,\nthere'll be no commission! [beat] Anyway... I appreciate you coming down\nand talking to\nme.

I guess they must have gotten it from that press release of\nsomething.\n\nTOBY\nI guess they must have. You don't think it'd be a better idea if you asked\nme first?\n\nANDY\nI really didn't.\n\nTOBY\nInteresting.\n\nANDY\nI find that when I skip over the first step and move right to the second step,\nit becomes\na lot harder for people to say no.\n\nToby stops suddenly.\n\nANDY\nListen, you'll have fun, you'll look nice in your tuxedo, you don't have to\nstay,\nyou don't have... [turns to him] Toby?\n\nTOBY\nSkip over the first step and move right to the second.\n\nC.J.\n[walking from behind Andy] Toby...

Make sure they know that he's a patriot,\nand when the\nPresident asked him to serve, Senator Gillette answered the call.\n\nC.J.\nDid he?\n\nTOBY\nYeah. I just saw it at your press briefing tomorrow morning.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, but this is really the last thing I'm doing before I quit.\n\nTOBY\n[as she walks away] Okay.\n\nAndy smiles approvingly.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

He whispers to the secretary and she\ncomes to\nMorgan Ross and talks to him quietly.\n\nPRODUCER 1\nAnd when we do, we suffer, because our products become demonized and\nmarginalized, and\nevery ten years the Government asks for something more.\n\nRoss steps outside.\n\nED\nThe only reason we have to come to you every ten years is that the situation\nisn't\ngetting any better.\n\nPRODUCER 1\nWhen's the government going to ask the NFL and the National Hockey League\nto put warning\nlabels on their games?\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Hitchcock never used sex or violence in his films.\n\nSAM\nYeah. Morgan, the President's never seen your movie, he's never heard of\nyour movie,\nhe has no particular objection to your movie, and you know it.\n\nROSS\nThe Family Values Leadership Council seems to see it differently.\n\nSAM\nGloriosky, Morgan, the Family Values Leadership Council distorted the\ntruth. Stop the\npresses.\n\nROSS\nWell, thanks to that ad, I've got exhibitors in Mississippi, Oklahoma and\nAlabama,\npulling the film!\n\nSAM\nI've read the press synopsis of the film, and if the exhibitors put you on\nevery screen\nof every multiplex in every mall you still wouldn't do any business in\nMississippi,\nOklahoma or Alabama.\n\nROSS\nYou're an industry expert now.\n\nSAM\nNo, but you are. Which explains a lot to me about Hollywood. And you know\nthe ad was\ngoing to get you more business than you lost and that's why you went on Imus\nand said\nwhat you did.\n\nROSS\nI'm here for a Sam Seaborn scolding?\n\nSAM\nYeah. Because it makes me crazy, Morgan, this is exactly the kind of thing\nthat should\nbe celebrated by First Amendment advocates. Charlie was offered a choice\nand he made one.\nWhy aren't you standing up, saying, \"See, it works! You don't need to ban\nmovies like\n\"Prince of New York\", you just have to choose not to watch them!\" And Morgan\nyou ever\ncall the President a coward again for your own PR purposes, it's not going\nto be C.J.\nCregg you gotta deal with, it's going to be me. You understand what I'm\nsaying, right?\n\nROSS\n[very slowly] Yes.\n\nSAM\nNow why don't you go back to your meeting and show me how much you want to\nmake it up\nto us.\n\nSam sits down at his desk, Ross leaves.

GRIFFITH\nI do not believe that is what I did, sir. I was asked, by and large, if\nmarijuana holds\nthe same addictive properties as heroin or LSD; it does not. I was asked if\nmarijuana\nposes a greater health risk than nicotine and alcohol, and in my opinion,\nit does not.\nAnd I believe if you look at the transcript...\n\nBARTLET\nMillie, did you put her up to it?\n\nDR.

GRIFFITH\nYou've been the king of whatever room you walked into her entire life.\n\nBARTLET\nIt never seemed to intimidate Zoey or Liz.\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nWell, kids are different, they're not the same! You would be amazed, you'd\nbe stunned\nat how soon they understand they're not their father's favorite.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's not true.\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nThat's not true.\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nNo, no, no. I will bear with the nonsense of the Christian right and the\nHollywood\nleft and the AFL-CIO and the AARP and the Canubus society and Japan, but I\nwill not\nstand and allow someone to tell me that I love one of my children less than\nthe others.\n[walks to the glass door] She's frightened of me?\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nShe ain't the only one.\n\nBARTLET\nI wanted to be so mad at her. I heard the news and my first thought was.. My\ngod,\n\"King Lear\" is a good play. [sighs] \"My father won't fire the Surgeon General,\nhe would\nnever do that.\" I wanted to be so mad at her. But the truth is, it's the\nnicest thing\nshe's ever said about me.\n\nDR.

This shouldn't stop you from doing\nthe bigger\nthings.\n\nBARTLET\nThese are the bigger things. I don't accept your resignation. [hands her\nthe paper]\nYou work for me. You go when I tell you to.\n\nDR. GRIFFITH\nYou're an excellent role model, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\n[walking out the glass door, turns] Yes, I know.\n\nDR.

[beat, while he looks at her gently] The only thing you ever had to\ndo to make me\nhappy was come home at the end of the day.\n\nEllie looks like she's about to cry.\n\nBARTLET\nSo, endocrinology would be what? Disorders of the gallbladder?\n\nELLIE\n[chokes the word] Thyroid.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm pretty sure you're wrong about that, I think endocrinology is your\nsub-specialty\nof internal medicine, devoted to the digestive system.\n\nELLIE\nThat would be gastroenterology.\n\nBARTLET\nAre you sure it's not nephrology, immunology, cardiology, or dermatology?\n\nELLIE\n[smiling] Would you stop it?

I've reviewed the recommendations from Justice and\nthe OPA and\nTribbey's office had its own recommendations.\n\nLEO\nHow many are you sending in?\n\nSAM\nEighteen, I think, now. Mail fraud, securities fraud, and truly the most\nbogus drug bust\nI've ever seen.\n\nLEO\nDon't retry the cases.\n\nSAM\nI'm not retrying the cases. I'm reading the material I'm supposed to read. I'm\nmaking the\nrecommendations I'm supposed to make.

You're tired, you slept in the office. It's Friday - go home.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nLEO\n'Cause I think you're putting too much faith in the magical powers of a new\nshirt.\n\nSAM\nLeo.\n\nLEO\nJosh told me what happened... with your parents.

The cops know exactly where\nthey're\ngoing to be and what's going to happen. You know how they know? By logging\nonto their\nwebsite. We had the underground.

I'll bet if we\ncomb through the fine print of history we might be able to find one or two\noccupants of\nthe Oval Office who could say the same thing. [Sam lowers his eyes.] But\nthe difference is\nour failures are public and our successes are private. So when we apprehend\nan enemy of the\nstate, like say, a fugitive member of West Virginia White Pride we don't\ntake a curtain\ncall on Sunday with Sam and Cokie. When we learned that it wasn't the Secret\nService who\nordered the canopy down in Rosslyn we kept is to ourselves.\n\nSAM\nPlease, God, Mike. Please tell me you weren't just threatening Toby Ziegler.\n\nCASPER\nI wasn't, Sam.\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nAnyway...\"Because the Bureau will be embarrassed\" isn't a good enough\nreason. I'm putting\nDaniel Gault on the list. I just wanted to give you a heads-up.\n\nCASPER\nAnything else?\n\nSAM\nNope.\n\nSam exits. Casper picks up the phone and starts dialing.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY\nPeople are standing near the podium with an AV display. C.J. enters, passes\nsign that\nreads Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality.\n\nC.J.\nHi. I'm sorry.\n\nDR. JOHN FALLOW\nHello.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry to be late.\n\nFALLOW\nNot a problem.\n\nC.J.\nI'm C.J. Cregg.\n\nFALLOW\nOf course you are. I'm Dr. John Fallow. This is Dr. Cynthia Sayles and\nProfessor Donald Huke.\n\nC.J.\nHuke?\n\nDONALD HUKE\nHuke.\n\nC.J.\nOkay. And you are the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality.\n\nFALLOW\nWell, we're from the OCSE. We have many members.\n\nC.J.\nHow many?\n\nFALLOW\n4300 dues-paying members.\n\nC.J.\nWhat are the dues?\n\nFALLOW\n$20 a year for the newsletter.\n\nC.J.\nLet's start.\n\nJosh enters from the back of room.\n\nJOSH\nWait. Wait, I want to see this.\n\nC.J.\nThis is Josh Lyman.\n\nFALLOW\nIndeed you are.\n\nC.J.\nJosh, this is Dr. Fallow...\n\nJOSH\nHi.\n\nC.J.\n...and his merry men.\n\nThe cartographers laugh politely.\n\nFALLOW\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nShould we begin?\n\nFALLOW\nYes.\n\nC.J. and Josh sit down.\n\nFALLOW\nPlain and simple, we'd like President Bartlet to aggressively support\nlegislation that\nwould make it mandatory for every public school in America to teach geography\nusing the\nPeters Projection Map instead of the traditional Mercator.\n\nJOSH\nGive me 200 bucks and it's done.\n\nHUKE\nReally?\n\nC.J.\nNo. Why are we changing maps?\n\nDR. CYNTHIA SAYLES\nBecause, C.J., the Mercator Projection has fostered European imperialist\nattitudes for\ncenturies and created an ethnic bias against a Third World.\n\nC.J.\nReally?\n\nFallow brings the map up on the projector.\n\nFALLOW\nThe German cartographer, Mercator, originally designed this map in 1569 as\na navigational\ntool for European sailors.\n\nHUKE\nThe map enlarges areas at the poles to create straight lines of constant\nbearing or\ngeographic direction.\n\nCYNTHIA SAYLES\nSo, it makes it easier to cross an ocean.\n\nFALLOW\nBut...\n\nC.J.\nYes?\n\nFALLOW\nIt distorts the relative size of nations and continents.\n\nC.J.\nAre you saying the map is wrong?\n\nFALLOW\nOh, dear, yes. Uh, look at Greenland.\n\nC.J.\nOkay...\n\nFALLOW\nNow look at Africa.\n\nC.J.\nOkay...\n\nFALLOW\nThe two landmasses appear to be roughly the same size.\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nFALLOW\nWould it blow your mind if I told you that Africa is in reality fourteen\ntimes larger?\n\nJosh nudges C.J. with his knee, C.J. pushes him back.\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nSAYLES\nHere we have Europe drawn considerably larger than South America when at\n6.9 million\nsquare miles South America is almost double the size of Europe's 3.8 million.\n\nHUKE\nAlaska appears three times as large as Mexico, when Mexico is larger by .1\nmillion\nsquare miles.\n\nSAYLES\nGermany appears in the middle of the map when it's in the northernmost\nquarter of the Earth.\n\nJOSH\nWait, wait. Relative size is one thing, but you're telling me that Germany\nisn't where we\nthink it is?\n\nFALLOW\nNothing's where you think it is.\n\nC.J.\nWhere is it?\n\nFALLOW\nI'm glad you asked. [brings up a new map, which has its continents significally\nsquished\nnorthward] The Peters Projection.\n\nC.J. and Josh lean forward.\n\nSAYLES\nIt has fidelity of axis.\n\nHUKE\nFidelity of position.\n\nSAYLES\nEast-west lines are parallel and intersect north-south axes at right angles.\n\nC.J.\nWhat the hell is that?\n\nFALLOW\nIt's where you've been living this whole time. Should we continue?\n\nJOSH\nUh-huh.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WORLD POLICY AUDITORIUM - DAY\nThe crowd is still yelling. Toby and Rhonda are at a table on stage.\n\nWEBBER\n[to protesters] Look, I'm not saying that we're going to like their\nanswers. I'm saying\nwe're going to give him a chance to talk. Now if you do have a question...\n\nPROTESTER 4\nYeah, my question is who elected his boss the people or Kaiser-Permanente?\n\nPROTESTER 5\nHe's not my President, let's vote.\n\nPROTESTER 6\nWho do you really work for?\n\nMore yelling.\n\nSACHS\n[to Toby] You're having a pretty good time, aren't you?\n\nTOBY\nWell, it's not like being at a Yankee game.\n\nPROTESTER 7\nYou suck!\n\nTOBY\nWell, actually... [chuckles] Yeah, it's like being at a Yankee game.\n\nSACHS\nSo, Toby?\n\nTOBY\nOfficer?\n\nSACHS\nSince you're not really doing anything right now, I was wondering, what's\nthis all about?\n\nTOBY\nIt's about the WTO, Rhonda, the World Trade Organization.\n\nSACHS\nWell, I get that from the signs and the newspapers.\n\nTOBY\nThe World Trade Organization's a group of 140 countries who have agreed to\nspecific trade\npolicies.\n\nSACHS\nSo, what's wrong with that?\n\nTOBY\nNothing's wrong with that.\n\nSACHS\nWhat would they say if I asked them the same question?\n\nTOBY\nThey'd say the WTO benefits corporations and not people.\n\nSACHS\nDoes it?\n\nTOBY\nBenefits both. [pause] Look at them.\n\nSACHS\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nPhilistines.\n\nSACHS\nTake my nightstick and go kick their ass.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, make all the jokes you want but let me tell you something they claim\nto speak for\nthe underprivileged but here in the blackest city in America, I'm looking\nat a room with\nno black faces. No Asians, No Hispanics. Where the hell's the Third World\nthey claim to\nrepresent?\n\nSACHS\nLot of Third-Worlders in the Cabinet Room today, were there?\n\nTOBY\nYou're starting to bother me.\n\nSACHS\nThat's 'cause I'm armed.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I like that.

They walk.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nHey, Charlie, what's going on?\n\nCHARLIE\nThe President lost his first choice of a site for the library.\n\nSAM\nWhat happened?\n\nCHARLIE\nThere's an 18th century farmhouse they can't take down.\n\nSAM\nThey'll find another site.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, anyway, he's kind of in a mood.\n\nSAM\nThey shouldn't be talking to him now about the library, anyway. We're not\ngoing anywhere\nfor a few years, right?\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, I think that's what's got him in a mood.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nCharlie continues walking, Sam breaks off and enters the COMMUNICATIONS\nOFFICE.\n\nGINGER\nSam, you just got a call.\n\nSAM\nGinger, do me a favor and catch the calls. I'm going to lie down in Toby's\noffice for a\nfew minutes.\n\nGINGER\nSam, it was the National Security Advisor.\n\nSam takes note.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY\nNancy McNally is alone, talking on the phone at the table.\n\nNANCY\nWell, he's talking about force protection, right? I'm sorry, Colonel, that\nwas me. He's\ntalking about force protection? Right, but the President's going to ask me\nabout the\nreadiness issue.\n\nThe door opens, Sam enters, and Nancy waves him over to the table.\n\nNANCY\nI'm saying he's going to want to distinguish readiness and force\nprotection. No, that\nwas me again. [to Sam with hand over receiver] I'm the only woman on a\nconference call.\nDelaney can't tell when it's me talking. Do I have a bizarrely androgynous\nvoice?\n\nSam shrugs and sits down.\n\nNANCY\n[into phone] Excuse me, I'm going to step off for just a minute.\n\nNancy hangs up phone, Sam sighs.\n\nNANCY\nHow you doing?\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nNANCY\nGood. Drop Daniel Gault.\n\nSAM\nNancy...\n\nNANCY\nDrop Daniel Gault, do it right now.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nNANCY\n'Cause I just told you to.\n\nSAM\nNancy, I'm a lawyer. Let's let reason and logic have its moment. There was\none witness.\n\nNANCY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nEarl Lydecker, a low level State Department staffer who confessed to FBI\ncounterintelligence\nofficers that he and Gault had conspired to send U.S. economic analysis\ndocuments to Soviet\nagents at the Russian embassy.\n\nNANCY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nHe confessed, by the way, for no particular reason.\n\nNANCY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nIt was subsequently demonstrated that Lydecker was a clinically diagnosed\nmanic-depressive\nwith a history of... wait for it... institutionalization. This was the chief\nwitness for\nthe prosecution. According to...\n\nNANCY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nExcuse me, please. According to retired KGB Colonel Oleg Prosorov a search\nof the files\nat Lubyanka reveals only one reference to Gault. That he was approached in\n1943 and\nlabeled \"highly uncooperative\" and a \"poor prospect for recruitment\".\n\nNANCY\nSam, Daniel Gault was a spy.\n\nSAM\n[incredulously] Oh my God...\n\nNANCY\nHe was a Soviet spy, Sam.\n\nSAM\nBased on what?\n\nNANCY\nDiplomatic cables intercepted by U.S. Army Signal Intelligence in the 1940s.\n\nSAM\nIf that was the case, why couldn't the U.S. Attorney make espionage in the\n1950s?\n\nNANCY\n'Cause the cables weren't decrypted until the 1970s.\n\nSAM\nYou're telling me that we cracked some obscure Russian code and suddenly we\nlearned Gault\nwas a spy?\n\nNANCY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nThat's crap. If the FBI had proof on Gault they would have told the world\nabout it.\n\nNANCY\nNo they wouldn't have, Sam.\n\nSAM\nNancy...\n\nNANCY\nNo they wouldn't have, neither would the NSA, neither would Central\nIntelligence. You don't\nshow someone you've broken their ciphers unless you have to. Gault was long\ndead. But before\nhe was, he was an agent called \"Black Water\". He was a delegate at Yalta. And\nhe returned\nto the U.S. by way of Rostov where he was awarded the Order of Lenin.\n\nSAM\nYeah, well, I'll believe that when they show me the file.\n\nNancy reaches behind her, picks up a heavy file and places it in front of Sam.\n\nSAM\nThat's not an FBI file.\n\nNANCY\nIt's an NSA file.\n\nSAM\nNancy, I'm classified but I don't have code word clearance.\n\nNANCY\nI know.\n\nSAM\nI'm saying I'm not allowed to see that and you could get into trouble for\nshowing it to me.\n\nNANCY\nI could go to jail for showing it to you, which obviously I'm not going to\ndo. [opens the\nfile] I have blacked out any lateral reference that is code word\nclassified. Those are the\nonly things I've blacked out and they are in no way relevant to your\nquestion. Look at me.\nDo you believe me?\n\nSAM\n[softly] Of course.\n\nNANCY\nGo ahead.\n\nSam starts reading. Nancy picks up the phone again.\n\nNANCY\nThis is Dr. Nancy McNally, the National Security Advisor. But again, that's\nforce\nprotection and not readiness....\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY\nThe camera pans from the OCSE group to C.J., standing.\n\nFALLOW\nSo, uh...

We're going to finish this.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nHUKE\nWhat do maps have to do with social equality, you ask?\n\nJOSH\nShe asked.\n\nHUKE\nSalvatore Natoli of the National Council for Social Studies argues \"In our\nsociety we\nunconsciously equate size with importance, and even power\".\n\nJosh and C.J. exchange looks.\n\nJOSH\nI'm going to check in on Toby.\n\nC.J.\nGo.\n\nJOSH\n[to C.J.] These guys find Brigadoon on that map you'll call me, right?\n\nC.J.\nProbably not.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. [exits]\n\nFALLOW\nWhen Third World countries are misrepresented they're likely to be valued\nless. When\nMercator maps exaggerate the importance of Western civilization, when the\ntop of the map\nis given to the northern hemisphere and the bottom is given to the\nsouthern... then people\nwill tend to adopt top and bottom attitudes.\n\nC.J.\nBut... wait. How... Where else could you put the Northern Hemisphere but on\nthe top?\n\nSAYLES\nOn the bottom.\n\nC.J.\nHow?\n\nFALLOW\nLike this.\n\nThe map is flipped over.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but you can't do that.\n\nFALLOW\nWhy not?\n\nC.J.\n'Cause it's freaking me out.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Food is cheaper.\n\nSACHS\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nFood is cheaper, clothes are cheaper, steel is cheaper, cars are cheaper,\nphone service\nis cheaper. You feel me building a rhythm here? That's 'cause I'm a\nspeechwriter and I\nknow how to make a point.\n\nSACHS\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nIt lowers prices, it raises income. You see what I did with 'lowers' and\n'raises' there?\n\nSACHS\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nIt's called the science of listener attention. We did repetition, we did\nfloating opposites\nand now you end with the one that's not like the others. Ready? Free trade\nstops wars. And\nthat's it. Free trade stops wars! And we figure out a way to fix the rest! One\nworld, one\npeace. I'm sure I've seen that on a sign somewhere.\n\nSACHS\nGod, Toby... Wouldn't it be great if there was someone around here with\ncommunication skills\nwho could go in there and tell them that?\n\nTOBY\nShut up.\n\nJosh enters through the police line.\n\nJOSH\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nJOSH\nCame down to see how it was going. [to Sachs] How's it going? Josh Lyman.\n\nSACHS\nRhonda Sachs.\n\nJOSH\nAny trouble?\n\nSACHS\nNo.\n\nTOBY\n[raises his hand] Josh. The WTO is undemocratic, and accountable to no one,\ndecisions\nare made by Executive Directors and the developing world has little to say\nabout\ninstitutional policy.\n\nJOSH\nWhat was that?\n\nTOBY\nI protested to you.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\n'Cause I'm not allowed to get arrested anymore.\n\nJOSH\nLet's go back.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I hate these people with the heat of a nova.

If you tell her tonight,\nthat's it.\n\nSAM\nDonna.\n\nDONNA\nIt was people pushing paper around fifty years ago. Why does it matter?\n\nBoth stop on the STAIRS.\n\nSAM\nIt was high treason, and it mattered a great deal! This country is an idea,\nand one that's\nlit the world for two centuries and treason against that idea is not just\na crime against\nthe living! This ground holds the graves of people who died for it, who gave\nwhat Lincoln\ncalled the last full measure of devotion. Of fidelity. You understand the\nlast full measure\nof devotion to... Treason against them is... [almost crying]\n\nDONNA\n[softly] Sam...\n\nSAM\nThere was a translator in the Hungarian trade mission named Shaba Demsky. She\nwas murdered\nin 1952.

Yields approximately four servings.\n\nSam is watching the television, looking quite dismayed.\n\nSAM\n(to himself) This isn't happening.\n\nSam looks at his watch as STACKHOUSE continues to read.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\n...sauce, or chili sauce...\n\nSam spots C.J. in the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nWhat the hell is he doing?\n\nSam and C.J. walk through into the CORRIDOR.\n\nC.J.\nIt's a recipe for deep fried fantail shrimp.\n\nSAM\nYeah. But, what's he still doing up there?\n\nC.J.\nHe's got a recipe book.\n\nSAM\nHow long will it go?\n\nC.J.\nI don't know.\n\nSAM\nI'm saying how many recipes are there?\n\nC.J.\nAll together?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nI can't cook, but I think there are probably like 20 or 30.\n\nSAM\nYou're screwing around with me.\n\nC.J.\nOh, yeah.\n\nSAM\nI'm about to miss the 7:30 shuttle. If I miss the 8:30, I miss the last\ntrain to\nSag Harbor.\n\nC.J. is handed a piece of paper by a staffer.\n\nC.J.\nYou can spend the night in New York.\n\nSAM\nI've only got two nights. And you've gotta see this house.\n\nC.J.\nIt's cool?\n\nSAM\nIt's Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nC.J.\nIs it cold in Sag Harbor right now?\n\nSAM\nWe wear sweaters. It's a Tommy Hilfiger ad.\n\nC.J.\nIt can't last forever.\n\nSAM\nHe's got twenty to thirty recipes he can read.\n\nSam stops walking while C.J. continues through swinging doors into the JOSH'S\nBULLPEN,\nstill talking to Sam.\n\nC.J.\nSam, seriously, there are more recipes than that.\n\nSAM\nWho cares? He's blowing my weekend in the Hamptons.\n\nC.J.\nMaybe he doesn't know about the sweaters.\n\nC.J. (VO)\nThe reason they needed to stick around was that the moment the filibuster's\nover, there\nwill be a vote and once they vote, I need my spin boys.\n\nC.J. is walking through JOSH'S BULLPEN.\n\nJOSH\nC.J....\n\nC.J.\nI know!\n\nJosh jumps up from his chair and walks with C.J. through the bullpen.\n\nJOSH\nWho gave him the recipe book?\n\nC.J.\nI really don't think we can blame this on the recipe book. Plus, I now know\nthe secret to\ncold asparagus chantilly is a quarter cup whipped cream.\n\nJOSH\nI'm going to Port Saint Lucie, which may not mean anything to you, but\nhappens to be the\nspring training home of the...\n\nC.J.\nNew York Jets. Yes, you've told me. Josh, you can watch basketball on T.V.\n\nJOSH\nYes, except the New York Knicks are a basketball team, the New York Jets\nare a football\nteam, and Port Saint Lucie is the spring training home of the New York...\n\nC.J.\n(exasperated) Mets! Yes. Dammit, I'm inadequate.\n\nJosh stops at the bottom of a small staircase that leads to the Briefing Room,\nwhile C.J.\ncontinues. C.J. stops at the top to listen to Josh.\n\nJOSH\nA weekend at spring training. Mike Piazza is going to be standing in the\nbatting cage.\n(strikes a batting pose) He's going to turn and see me. He's going to say,\n'Dude.'\n\nC.J.\nWell, I wouldn't want you to miss a legitimate 'dude' sighting.\n\nJOSH\n(excited) So I can take off?\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nC.J. walks into the PRESS BRIEFING ROOM which is full of reporters.\n\nC.J. (VO)\nWhy do I need the spin? Because it's a bipartisan bill and I'm all for\nbipartisanship\nas long as we get the credit. So, I've taken the press corps hostage.\n\nThe moment C.J. enters and heads for the podium, all of the reporters start\ncalling her\nname. A television in the room is tuned to Stackhouse on C-SPAN2 as he\ncontinues to talk.\n\nC.J.\nGuys, I'm sorry, but you know what? Listen, seriously, you're looking at\ndemocracy at\nwork, it's a beautiful thing.\n\nREPORTER 1\nAnd how much more beauty can we be expecting tonight, C.J.\n\nC.J.\nWell, I wouldn't think it would be that much longer.\n\nREPORTER 2\nHe's got a recipe book.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but how many recipes can there be? 20? 30?\n\nAnother reporter, Mark, rushes up to C.J.\n\nMARK\n(in a loud whisper) C.J., it's Friday night. I'm supposed to have dinner\nwith my\ngirlfriend. She's going to kill me.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but you know what, Mark? This is just the kind of thing that can\ncleanse the palate\nof a relationship that's gone stale. Like a fine sorbet.\n\nMARK\nWe've been going out three weeks.\n\nC.J.\nAnd she's already bitching about dinner?\n\nMARK\nC.J....\n\nC.J.\nLose her.\n\nMark goes back to his seat as C.J. walks behind the podium. The reporters\nstart to call\nher name again.\n\nC.J.\nListen up! Everybody, this was unforeseen. Obviously, he's got to finish\nsometime. When\nhe does, there will be a vote immediately. When it's done, the President\nwill make his\ncalls, White House staff will be available for comment, and most important\nyou will all\nwrite about it. In the mean time, I say, pizza for everybody! Who's with me?\n\nThe room is silent.\n\nC.J.\nExcellent!\n\nC.J. gathers her papers and leaves. Carol meets her outside the door and\nfollows\nC.J. through the CORRIDOR.\n\nC.J.\nWe're going to need like a massive truckload of pizza. And, I don't know,\nmaybe some\nCuervo 1800 if we've got some lying around.\n\nCAROL\nHow much?\n\nC.J.\nJust enough for me.\n\nToby approaches.\n\nTOBY\nC.J. Just so you know, I need to be in Telluride first thing in the morning.\n\nC.J.\nThat's a rough assignment you pulled there.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I'm saying, I already missed the 6:50 to Denver, but I can catch an 8:40\nfrom\nNational if I change planes in Chicago.\n\nC.J. and Toby enter C.J.'S OFFICE. Toby is bouncing his pink rubber ball.\n\nC.J.\nAnd as you're travel agent, it's important that you update me on that\ninformation.\n\nTOBY\nC.J....\n\nC.J.\nI'm supposed to be on my way to Napa right now for my Dad's 70th birthday. You\nhear me\ncomplaining?\n\nTOBY\nYou just did.\n\nC.J.\nGet out.\n\nC.J. sits behind her desk with her computer.\n\nTOBY\nIt's your dad's 70th birthday?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nYou doing anything?\n\nC.J.\nYeah, we're all getting together in Napa.\n\nTOBY\n(quietly) I meant right now.\n\nC.J.\nNo. I'm sitting and waiting. I'm ordering pizza. I'm catching up on e-mails.\n\nTOBY\nAll right. I got a a basketball game on in my office if you want to come by?\n\nC.J.\nIs it the Jets and the Mets?\n\nTOBY\nIt's the Nets and the Hawks. [with disdain] The Jets and the Mets?\n\nC.J.\nI know the teams. I'm joking when I do this. I'm joking when I do this.\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nToby turns to leave, then turns back around.\n\nTOBY\nYou know there's a 9:00 to SFO. You could drive to Napa.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nAll right. I'm in my office.\n\nC.J. turns to look at the television, where Stackhouse is still speaking.\n\nC.J.\nIt'll end.\n\nTOBY\nDo you have any idea how many recipes there are?\n\nC.J.\nI really don't.\n\nToby leaves.\n\nSTACKHOUSE (on T.V.)\n...teaspoon of dry mustard...\n\nC.J. begins to type.\n\nC.J. (VO)\nSo, the press is in the briefing room. The staff is in the West Wing. And\nI'm right here.\nI'm betting when you read this, you're going to be glad I stayed. I'm betting\nyou're\ngoing to end up rooting for a Minnesota Senator named Howard Stackhouse. 'Cause\nI gotta\ntell ya, this doesn't seem like any old filibuster.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nC.J. continues typing her e-mail.\n\nC.J. [VO]\nIt's our first filibuster, and I'm not a rules expert, but the rules of a\nfilibuster are\nsimple enough-you keep the floor as long as you hold the floor. What does\nthat mean?\nIt means you can't stop talking, ever. You can't eat, and you can't drink,\nwhich is fine,\nbecause you can't leave the chamber to use the bathroom, either. But all\nthat's nothing\ncompared to this: you're not allowed to sit down-you're not allowed to lean\non anything\nor, for that matter, anyone. It started with the bill you'll read about\ntomorrow morning\ncalled the Family Wellness Act. Josh had been leading staffers from the\nLegislative\nLiaison Office in negotiations with the conference chairman for weeks and\nthis last\nMonday morning he walked into the Roosevelt Room and said...\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I will once again and betray the sisterhood.\n\nJosh and the other men look down with small smiles.\n\nC.J.\n[pointing to each] Okay, I saw you, you, you, and you roll your eyes.\n\nLARRY\nYou weren't even looking at me.\n\nC.J.\nI felt you.\n\nLEO\n[standing with others and clapping] We're done!

I mean, he stuck sunsets on a bunch of small-ticket\nitems, but...\n\nJOSH\nBut that's the way it's gonna happen.\n\nLEO\nYou just spent six billion dollars on health care. How do you feel?\n\nJOSH\nI'd feel better if it meant just once I could go to a doctor without filling\nout\nsomething on a clipboard.\n\nLEO\nAll right, what else?\n\nTOBY\nPhilip Sluman, who's the chairman of the Petroleum Producers of America,\ntestified\nyesterday to the FTC that \"the Bartlet administration's\" - blah, blah -\n\"relentless\npursuit of emissions standards in the form of additives like MTBE is a big\nreason we've\nseen price hikes in some of the country.\"\n\nLEO\nThe Energy Secretary's gotta respond.\n\nTOBY\nThe Energy Secretary's gonnaa respond and I'd like to mention that to the\nVice President.\n\nLEO\nYou want me to do it?\n\nTOBY\nI got it.\n\nLEO\nHe's gonna be pretty unhappy.\n\nTOBY\nYep.\n\nLEO\nAnything else?\n\nTOBY\nNo...\n\nC.J.\nNope.\n\nJOSH\nNo sir, thank you.\n\nThey all exit.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Did you know\nthat?\n\nTOBY\nI knew it was pretty big.\n\nHOYNES\nWhat do you need?\n\nTOBY\n[as both sit] Philip Sluman, testifying yesterday in front of the FTC,\ncharged that it\nwas the White House's pursuit of tighter emissions standards that has caused\nthe rise\nin prices...\n\nHOYNES\nPhil Sluman had a good point.\n\nTOBY\nMr. Vice President, I don't want to go round and round with you on Sluman.\n\nHOYNES\nOkay.\n\nTOBY\nHe had no point.\n\nHOYNES\nPolicy forces them to use expensive additives whose benefits are questionable.\n\nTOBY\nIt's price gouging...\n\nHoynes shrugs his shoulders.\n\nTOBY\nIt costs marginally more to refine the fuel with the additives and the cost\nis being\npassed on to the consumer at an outrageous markup.\n\nHOYNES\nToby, if a refinery shuts down, if there's a fire, which isn't, like, out\nof the question\nwhen you're dealing with petroleum, production comes to a halt, gas becomes\nscarce,\nprices go up, then they come back down.\n\nTOBY\nWell, it's good to know the companies can make it through the lean times.\n\nHOYNES\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nAnyway, sir, tomorrow night, Bill Trotter's gonna be delivering a speech to\nthe Detroit\nEconomic Counsel on Energy Efficiency in the 21st century, and we're gonna\nrewrite the\ndraft to include a fairly strong rebuttal to Phillip Sluman's remarks.\n\nHOYNES\n[clears throat] Shouldn't have Bill Trotter do it.\n\nTOBY\nWhy?\n\nHOYNES\n'Cause his rants against the oil companies have become familiar and the\npress has stopped\nwriting about them.\n\nTOBY\nStill...\n\nHOYNES\nIt's also pretty dicey political terrain for the Energy Secretary.\n\nTOBY\nWho would you send?\n\nHOYNES\n[standing] To punch back? Me.\n\nTOBY\nReally?\n\nHOYNES\nI'm having a press conference tomorrow afternoon to announce an advisory\ngroup for the\nantitrust policy.

[VO]\nI'll get back to the cat story in a second, cause I have to interrupt to\nsay this: if you\never have a free two hours and are so inclined, try standing up without\nleaning on\nanything and talking the whole time. You won't make it. I wouldn't make\nit. Stackhouse\nwasn't supposed to last 15 minutes. He's 78 years old. He has a head cold. This\nbill is\ngoing to pass. He has no hope, to say nothing of I can't imagine what the\nhell it is he's\nfighting for. Stackhouse wasn't supposed to last 15 minutes.\n\nSTACKHOUSE [on T.V.]\nThat is how you prepare Virginia Green apple pie. Let's turn now to David\nCopperfield...\n\nC.J.\n[still typing] Well, somebody forgot to tell Stackhouse, Dad, cause he just\nwent into\nhour number eight.\n\nSTACKHOUSE [on T.V.]\n...1870, began this great work...\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY\nThe camera tracks the halls of the West Wing. As it approaches LEO'S OFFICE,\nwe hear Josh.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nThe message was pretty cryptic... like something you'd slip a the bank\nteller. And it was\nunusual to get it directly from a Senator, who'd normally dispatch an\naide. Leo agreed,\nbut was in no way concerned. He told me to go ahead, take the meeting,\nand not to sweat\nit, and under no circumstances give anything away.\n\nDuring the voiceover, we see Leo and Josh talk. Josh takes the memo from\nLeo and exits.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. THE CAPITOL HILL - DAY\n\nJOSH [VO]\nSo I headed up to the Hill... wearing, by the way, the new shoes you bought\nme, which I'd\nnever worn before.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nJosh slides in from camera left and falls on his butt.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nSince Dad's not here to do it, I think it's my job to bore you with history\nnow. The\nfilibuster has been part of parliamentary strategy in this country for over\na hundred\nand fifty years. Now, the reason we weren't sweating Stackshouse is that\nStackhouse isn't\nsomeone you sweat. He's been around forever, but he has little influence,\nlittle power,\nand few friends. So, Dad would want me to tell you where the word 'filibuster'\ncomes\nfrom. It's from the Dutch \"ury geiter,\" which translated literally means\n\"freebooter.\"\nBut what they meant was, \"buccaneer.\"\n\nDuring the voiceover, we see Josh walk to SENATOR STACKHOUSE'S OFFICE. He\nremoves his\ncoat as the Senator beckons him in.\n\nJOSH\nAfternoon, Senator.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nGood afternoon. [coughs]\n\nJOSH\nSounds like a bad cold.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nIt's fine.\n\nJOSH\nYou taking anything?\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nI don't want to talk about my cold. I want forty seven million dollars to\nfight autism.\n\nJOSH\nSir...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nFive \"Centers of Excellence\" in universities around the country to help\nscientists\ncoordinate their research, three special units for autism epidemeilogy at\nthe CDC,\nand a centralized facility for gene and brain banking. That's 43 million.\n\nJOSH\nSenator...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nUh, the other four million is for a federal program to educate doctors in\norder to reduce\nthe staggeringly high percentage of cases in which autism is misdiagnosed.\n\nJOSH\nWe can't do it.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nOf course you can. You simply pick up the phone, you call the Conference\nChairman, and...\n\nJOSH\nThe bill started out at two billion. It's six billion now.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nThat's right. So another forty seven million hurts you how?\n\nJOSH\nSir...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nIt's eight tenths of one percent of a bill aimed at the health issues\naffecting children,\nwhich is roughly the same as the percentage of children affected by autism.\n\nJOSH\nI don't need to tell you that in these negotiations...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nIn these negotiations about a bill aimed at health issues affecting children,\nwe've\nallocated funds for Alzheimer's, glaucoma, and erectile dysfunction.\n\nJOSH\nSir...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nYou know a lot of two year olds afflicted with that horrific condition, hmm?\n\nJOSH\n[smiling] There's no doubt that that's a good point, but in order for us to\nensure that\nmore important things were in the bill...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nSo there was a determination made.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry?\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nA determination was made, in order of priorities.\n\nJOSH\nSenator, there's going to be a vote. The bill's closed.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nOpen it back up again.\n\nJOSH\nTo do that would mean to postpone the vote, and everyone's breaking for the\nrecess, and...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nAnd you want the story before everyone goes home.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nOkay. [gets up and walks to the door]\n\nJOSH\nSir, the next time around, and there will be a next time around...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nThat's all. I'm done with you now.\n\nHe waves his hand dismissively at Josh and walks out.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nAnd that was that.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Josh turns back to the computer.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nDonna says hi, Mom. Anyway, I didn't think much about the meeting with\nStackhouse\nafterward. There are always going to be people who don't get what they\nwant. I was\nthinking of other things.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT\nHoynes is having a press conference. Toby is watching from the back of the\nroom.\n\nJOSH [VO]\nLike Toby, I was puzzled as to why the Vice President, who made his money\nfrom the oil\nindustry, who champions the oil industry, would volunteer to admonish the\noil industry.\n\nSTEVE\nSir, I'm sure you're aware that Phillip Sluman testified before the FTC that\nthe Bartlet\nadministration's relentless pursuit of stricter emissions standards in the\nform of\nadditives is why we're seeing price spikes.\n\nHOYNES\nYeah.\n\nSTEVE\nWould you comment on that?\n\nHOYNES\nYeah. Our relentless pursuit of cleaner air standards has resulted in lower\nasthma rates\nand the cleanest air in California in 50 years. It costs marginally more to\nrefine fuel\nwith additives, but the costs are being passed on to consumers at an outrageous\nprice.\n\nCHRIS\nMr. Vice President.\n\nHOYNES\nUh, yeah, Chris.\n\nCHRIS\nAre you accusing members of the PPA of price gouging?\n\nHOYNES\nWell, some of these CEOs are old friends of mine. But, uh, I can tell you\nthey do know\nhow to turn a profit. Now, they'll claim that prices will go back down after\nproduction\nincreases...\n\nJOSH [VO]\nHoynes just kept hammering away, and I was reminded for a minute how close\nhe came to\nbeing elected President.\n\nHOYNES\n...have created a new bottom line...\n\nJOSH [VO]\nToby said it was an impressive display from Hoynes, but couldn't get past\nthe question\nof why he volunteered to do it.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nJOSH [VO]\nAnd if you're wondering what the President does during a filibuster, I dunno\n'cause this is our first. But at the moment, he's in his private dining room\nhaving dinner. There's a famous French chef visiting, and every time he comes\nhe cooks for the President.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Cassoulet, duck with green olives...\n\nLEO\nYeah...\n\nBARTLET\n...saffron chicken...\n\nLEO\nI haven't had a good saffron chicken in quite some time.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, don't you think you deserve one?\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nHis specialty is his dessert: Tomate de Saltambique.\n\nLEO\nThat's gonna be a big, seedless beefsteak tomato stweed for three hours in\ncreme de\ncaramel and stuffed with...\n\nBARTLET\nPassion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts, and...\n\nLEO\n...served on a pomegranate reduction, yes.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go.

I am full of mirth.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nHe was all over me the first year. He called me, \"Bartlet the Inert.\"\n\nLEO\nThat was pretty funny.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm a reformer. I'm the most liberal President he's ever served under. His\nhero, Hubert\nHumphrey, once, you know...\n\nLEO\nShook your hand.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's right. [silence] I feel bad.\n\nLEO\nWhy?\n\nBARTLET\nHis wife died a few years ago. I didn't go to the funeral.\n\nLEO\nWhy?\n\nBARTLET\nI was kind of busy running for President, Leo.\n\nLEO\nThat's right.\n\nBARTLET\nTomate de Saltambique, my friend.\n\nLEO\nYes, indeed.\n\nThey reach the DINING ROOM, which is lit by candlelight.\n\nBUTLER\nGood evening.\n\nBARTLET\nHi. Hang on. [to Leo] They thought I was going to be eating with Abbey, so...\n\nLEO\nHmm...\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll just, you know, pretend there's no candlelight.\n\nLEO\nAnd that we're not paranoid homophobes in any way.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLeo's cell phone rings.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, you have a deputy who's, frankly, a lot smarter than you are. Whatever\nit is, let\nhim handle it. Who are you talking to?\n\nLEO\nMy deputy. [into phone] Yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat did he say?\n\nLEO\nHe says there's no end in sight.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.

Can you help us out?\"\n\nLEO\nBecause he...\n\nBARTLET\nDamn it. He knows we would have gotten it done. Why doesn't he tell me?\n\nLEO\nBecause he doesn't want to make political hay out of his grandson, which is\ncommendable.\n\nBARTLET\nNah, he's a crank.\n\nC.J.\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nHey. Hey Donna, you need something?\n\nC.J.\nDonna's the one who started sniffing around it.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J., that phone message was for real.

I appreciate it.\n\nHOYNES\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nI'm sure you know I was curious about why you'd volunteer for something like\nthat.\n\nHOYNES\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nSo I got a hold of some private polling you've had done.\n\nHOYNES\nOh. Yeah?\n\nTOBY\nA significant number of people are concerned over your close ties to big oil.\n\nHOYNES\nWell, not anymore.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, but what I was wondering was why did you put the poll in the field at\nall?\nMr. Vice President, what do you know that I don't?\n\nHOYNES\nToby, the total tonnage of what I know that you don't could stun a team of\noxen in its\ntracks.

THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\nThe staff throughout the building are frantically calling Senators.\n\nJOSH\nEveryone was enlisted. You called everyone you had a relationship with...\n\nSAM\n...with and if you didn't get anywhere, they got a call from the President.\n\nC.J.\nDo I have your word on that, Sarah?\n\nJOSH\nWe'd been at it 20 minutes and we were coming up with...\n\nSAM\n...nothing, until...\n\nC.J.\nGot it!\n\nSAM\nSenator Tom Grissom of Washington State was headed from his office...\n\nC.J.\n...to the Chamber and everybody started flooding into the Communications\nBullpen to see\nwhat would happen, the problem being of course...\n\nSAM\n...Stackhouse would have to know as much about rules and procedures as Donna\nhad and not\nthink we were trying to screw him.\n\nJOSH\nWe stared at 14 different television sets while calculating in our heads\nthe time it\nwould take Grissom to walk from his office...\n\nC.J.\n...to the floor and we were in frozen silence while we listened to the rules\nof blackjack.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\n...unless you are counting cards.\n\nC.J.\nAnd then it happened.\n\nTOM GRISSOM\nPoint of order, Mr. Chairman.\n\nCHAIRMAN\nMr. Grissom?\n\nGRISSOM\nWill the Senator yield for a question?\n\nSAM\nCome on.\n\nCHAIRMAN\nMr. Stackhouse?\n\nJOSH\nCome on.\n\nBARTLET\nTrust me just this once, you grouchy old son of a bitch.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nMr. Chairman, I yield to the Senator from Washington for a question.\n\nGRISSOM\nMy question is in 22 parts and might take quite a while. Perhaps you'd like\nto sit and\nhave some water while I ask it.\n\nThe COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE explodes with cheers.\n\nC.J.\nAnd that was it. Grissom gave him a rest and an opportunity to answer some\nreal questions\nabout autism, and when Grissom was done, McNamara took over, and after\nMcNamara came\nGianelli, grandfathers all. I'm going to have to finish this up now and go\ninto the\npress room and explain what happened. There'll be no vote tonight and the\nSenate will\ngo home...\n\nJOSH\n...for the week. And since Stackhouse, with our help, blew the print deadline\nanyway,\nthere's really no reason...\n\nSAM\n...for Josh not to go back to the Conference Chairman and reopen the bill.\n\nC.J.\nThere are so many days here where you can't imagine that anything good will\never happen.\nYou're...\n\nJOSH\nYou're buried under a black fog of partisanship and self promotion and...\n\nSAM\n...stupidity and a brand of politics that's just plain mean...\n\nC.J.\nYes, Hoynes had us nervous with his admonishment of big oil and yes, the\nPresident was\nmaking us nervous too, but that's for tomorrow 'cause tonight I've seen a\nman with no\nlegs stay standing Dad, and a guy with no voice keep shouting and if politics\nbrings out\nthe worst in people then maybe people bring out the best 'cause I'm looking\nat the TV\nright now and damned if 28 US Senators haven't just walked onto the floor\nto help. I'll\ncatch the first plane out in the morning and if you wouldn't mind not turning\n70 until\ntomorrow that'd be great. In the meantime, I love you so much.

Toby, about 10 years ago, for a period of a few months,\nI was feeling\nrun down and had a pain in my leg. They both subsided, but 8 years ago,\nthe pain came\nback, as well as numbness.

I won't tell you all of them.\n\nTOBY\nWhy not?\n\nLEO\nBecause it's not entirely my business. I'm not sure of my footing here.

They believe it's headed to a safe house\nin Patterson,\nNew Jersey, and the FBI thinks they can apprehend him in 24 hours.

I'm\ncovered.\nMake a law for somebody else.\n\nJOSH\nAll right here's a joke based on the premise is that the party afterwards\nis hard to\nget into and the President is the Commander-In-Chief. \"I hear the Bloomberg\nparty is\ngonna be hard to get into this year but I'm not worried. I'm going the party\nwith the\n82nd Airborne.\"\n\nDONNA\nAnd then the President says \"Wow, I haven't heard a room this quiet since\nwe lost the\nsignal on Galileo.\"\n\nJOSH\nOr \"Wow, I haven't seen my staff update their resumes this fast since the\nlast time I\ntanked at the Correspondent's Dinner!\"\n\nDONNA\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nDONNA\n[condescending] When you yell you make it harder for people to find the funny.\n\nJOSH\nHey, who gave you those flowers on your desk?\n\nDONNA\nYou mean a man who can't read a calendar?\n\nJOSH\nSam.

Control of some nuclear\nweapons had\nbeen put in the field.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nTOBY\nSo, in the middle of a... I don't know what you call them...\n\nBARTLET\nAn episode.\n\nTOBY\n...You were in the Situation Room as Commander-In-Chief.\n\nBARTLET\n[sarcastically] I know. I can't believe we're all still here.\n\nBartlet takes a drink and stares at Toby.\n\nTOBY\nMr....\n\nBARTLET\nThe episode was over. Leo was with me. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was\nwith me as\nwere the Secretaries of State and Defense.\n\nTOBY\nDo you receive medication?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry?\n\nTOBY\nDo you receive medication?\n\nBARTLET\nI get injections of Betaseron.\n\nTOBY\nFrom whom?\n\nBARTLET\nFrom a doctor.\n\nTOBY\nNone of your current doctors are aware of your condition... Mr. President,\nis your wife\nmedicating you?\n\nLeo enters.\n\nBARTLET\nI think it would be best while temperature are running a little high if you\nrefer to my\nwife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.\n\nTOBY\n[quietly] Yes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat you got, Leo?\n\nLeo steps around the couch and hands Bartlet a folder.\n\nLEO\nThey'd like a few more minutes.\n\nBARTLET\nThe FAA?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBartlet rises and they walk to his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nTalk me through what heightened security means.\n\nLEO\nWell, they deploy more uniformed police and the dogs.

Eliminate the first two rows of short term parking.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, they want a few minutes?\n\nLEO\nYeah\n\nBARTLET\n[sarcastic] Toby's concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered last year\nin Kashmir\nwas the result of a drug induce haze.\n\nToby looks at the President.\n\nLEO\n[to Toby] I was there with him. So was Fitz. So was Cashman, Hutchinson,\nBerryhill...\n\nTOBY\nWell, that's fantastic.\n\nLEO\nToby!\n\nTOBY\nNone of you were elected!\n\nBARTLET\nI was elected, they were appointed. [points at Leo] The Vice President was\nelected.\nHe has the constitutional authority to assume my...\n\nTOBY\nNot last May he didn't. [rises] He didn't last May when you were under\ngeneral anesthesia.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's because I never signed the letter and I don't think I got shot because\nI got MS.\n\nTOBY\nI don't think you did either, sir. I meant that during a night of extreme\nchaos and fear,\nwhen we didn't yet know if we'd been the victims of domestic or-or foreign\nterrorism or\neven an act of war there was uncertainty as to who was giving the National\nSecurity\norders and that was because you never signed a letter!\n\nLeo looks uncomfortable. The President glares at Toby.\n\nTOBY\nI don't like to wonder, given your condition and it's lack of predictability\nwhy there\nisn't simply a signed letter sitting in a file someplace? And the answer\nis... [laughs]\nof course, if there was a-a signed letter sitting in a file someplace,\nsomebody would\nask why.\n\nBartlet looks angrily at Leo.\n\nTOBY\n[angry] The Commander-In-Chief had just been attacked. He was under a general\nanesthetic.\nA fugitive was at large, the manhunt included every federal, state and local\nlaw\nenforcement agency. The Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nDelaware\nNational Guard was federalized! The KH-10 showed Republican Guard movement\nin southern\nIraq. [yelling] And twelve hours earlier an F-117 was shot down in the no fly,\nand the\nVice President's authority was murky at best!\n\nBarely controlling his anger, Bartlet walks behind his desk.\n\nTOBY\nThe National Security Advisor and Secretary of State didn't know who they\nwere taking\ntheir orders from! I wasn't in the Situation Room that night but I'll bet\nall the money\nin my pockets against all the money in your pockets that it was Leo... who\nno one elected!\nFor 90 minutes that night there was a coup d'etat in this country.\n\nBartlet stands furious. Leo looks at Toby.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.\n\nLEO\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\n[angry] No, Toby's concern for my health is moving me in ways...\n\nTOBY\nMr. President....\n\nBartlet furiously throws the folder across his desk.\n\nBARTLET\n[yelling] SHUT UP!\n\nBartlet stalks back around the desk and faces Toby.\n\nBARTLET\n[condescending] You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting\nto me if it\nwasn't quite so covered in crap!\n\nCharlie stands in the doorway.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\n[while glaring at Toby] Yeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. Garreth.\n\nBARTLET\n[acknowledges Charlie] Thanks.\n\nCharlie quietly closes the door behind him.\n\nBARTLET\n[angry] Are you pissed because I didn't say anything or are you pissed\nbecause there\nwere 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for\nasking.\n\nBartlet walks to the other side of the room. Leo, standing between them,\nstares in shock.\nHe puts his hand to his forehead. Toby stands quietly looking at nothing.\n\nLEO\n[to Bartlet] Take the call in here.\n\nBartlet nods.\n\nLEO\n[to Toby] We'll step outside for a minute.\n\nLeo motions to the door. Bartlet glares at Toby. Toby looks at him quickly\nbefore\nfollowing Leo out. Bartlet walks back over to the couches and collects\nhimself for\na moment. He then picks up the phone.\n\nBARTLET\n[into phone] Yeah, this is the President.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT\nSam, Donna, Josh, Ainsley, Larry and Ed are sitting at the large table and\nare huddled\naround an easel, brainstorming ideas for the speech.\n\nSAM\nSelf-deprecation.\n\nED\nYes.\n\nSAM\nSelf-deprecation is what we need.\n\nLARRY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nSelf-deprecation is the appetizer of charm.\n\nED\nWe need jokes about the staff.\n\nSAM\nWe need jokes about the staff.\n\nAINSLEY\n[to Sam] Let's start with you.\n\nSAM\nProblem is there aren't many jokes you can make about me.\n\nDONNA\nHow about this. Um, \"Knock knock.\" \"Who's there?\" \"Sam and his prostitute\nfriend.\"\n\nAinsley, Ed and Larry laugh.\n\nSAM\nSee, I think that was a bit of misdirected anger there.\n\nDONNA\nI'm okay with that.\n\nSAM\nWell, in that case, Ainsley, you know why I got you flowers in April instead\nof February?\n'Cause you ditched me the first time around to go back to the guy who ditched\nyou the\nfirst time around only to have him ditch you the second time around.\n\nDonna smacks Josh upside the back of the head.\n\nJOSH\nOw! What the hell? That was him!\n\nDONNA\nHe was being you!\n\nJOSH\nWell, in fairness, I think everybody should have a turn. Sam, is there\nanything we can\npull, anything funny we can recycle?\n\nSAM\nYeah, pull something I wrote from October called \"Government-wide\nAccountability for\nMerit System Principles.\"\n\nJOSH\nThat one was a real barn-burner, was it?\n\nJosh stands up from the table, groaning, and exits the room to find the old\nspeech.\n\nDONNA\n[to Sam] Do you have any idea how much grief I took from him when I came back?\n\nSAM\nHow much?\n\nDONNA\nNone. I walked in the door. He said, \"Thank God. There's a pile of stuff on\nthe desk.\"\nThis is his way. He's just going to snark me every April. Prince of\npassive-aggressive\nbehavior.\n\nSAM\nWhat does \"snark\" mean?\n\nDONNA\nI don't know, but he's doing it.\n\nSAM\nThere any coffee left?\n\nED\nIn the mess.\n\nSAM\nAnybody want anything?\n\nAINSLEY\nDo you think they have cheesecake down there?\n\nSAM\n[looks at his watch] It's quarter after midnight. The pastry chef usually\nstays on\ntill dawn.\n\nAINSLEY\nI'll go see if there is.\n\nSam and Ainsley leave together out to the HALLWAY.\n\nSAM\nYou know, we should make a joke about women, since there's no law against\nthat or paying\nthem less money than men.\n\nAINSLEY\nWell, there is a law against that. It's the Pay Equity Act, passed in 1964,\nwhen women\nwere making fifty-nine cents to the dollar.\n\nSAM\nWhat are you making now?\n\nAINSLEY\nSeventy-nine cents.\n\nSAM\nSo, everything's fine.\n\nAINSLEY\nNo, there are still some problems. But I'm not worried 'cause the federal\ngovernment's\ncoming to the rescue.\n\nSAM\nLook...\n\nAINSLEY\nYou think pay disparity is 'cause some sexist in human resources hired two\npeople for\nequal positions and paid the man more?\n\nSAM\nOftentimes...\n\nAINSLEY\nAnd oftentimes women make less money over the course of their lifetimes\nbecause they\nchoose to.\n\nSAM\nOh, goodnight nurse! They don't choose to make less money. They're financially\npunished\nfor having kids.\n\nAINSLEY\nThey make a choice to have kids.\n\nSAM\nWell, not necessarily if you guys have your way, but that's a different can\nof tuna.\n[beat] I flat-out guarantee you that if men were biologically responsible for\nprocreation, there'd be paid family leave in every Fortune 500.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam, if men were biologically responsible for procreation, they'd fall down\nand die at\nthe first sonogram.\n\nSam and Ainsley walk into THE MESS. Sam checks out the coffee maker while\nAinsley gathers\nup cups and saucers.\n\nSAM\nIf the Amendment's redundant, what's your problem if it's passed or not?\n\nAINSLEY\nBecause I'm a Republican! Have we met? I believe that every time the federal\ngovernment\nhands down a new law, it leaves for the rest of us a little less freedom. So\nI say,\nlet's just stick to the ones we absolutely need to have water come out of\nthe faucet\nand our cars not stolen. That is my problem with passing a redundant law.\n[stands next to Sam with a full tray] Sam?\n\nSAM\nYeah?\n\nAINSLEY\nThe all-night pastry chef? You were just kidding about that, right?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nAinsley shoves the tray at Sam and walks toward the exit.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT\nToby sits on a bench with his head in his hand. Leo walks slowly toward him\nfrom the\ndirection of the Residence. Toby looks up as Leo approaches.\n\nLEO\nHe's still on the phone with State in the Residence.\n\nLeo looks across the White House grounds as thunder rumbles in the distance.\n\nTOBY\nSo Hoynes knows?\n\nLEO\nHmm?\n\nTOBY\nHoynes is one of the 16?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nAnd he thinks the President won't run again?\n\nLEO\nHe thinks there's a chance.\n\nTOBY\nWill he?\n\nLEO\n[sits] Will the President run?\n\nTOBY\nWhere's the First Lady?\n\nLEO\nIn Manchester.\n\nTOBY\nWhy'd she come to me after the State of the Union?\n\nLEO\nToby...\n\nLeo looks at Toby, looks away, shakes his head, looks back at him.\n\nTOBY\nWhy's she mad at the President? It's because the State of the Union set up\nthe\nre-election run and somehow she's under the impression that's not supposed\nto happen.\n\nLEO\nThe First Lady...\n\nTOBY\nI have no kind of investigative mind. Zero. It took me six days and 23\nminutes to\nfigure it out.\n\nLEO\nHe'll run.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, yeah 'cause we stood in that office a couple of months ago, you and I,\nand you\nsaid, \"Take my hand,\" and we just...\n\nLeo bows his head and nods. Toby looks drained and puts his hand to his head\nagain.\n\nTOBY\nNever mind.\n\nLEO\nHe'll run.\n\nTOBY\nHoynes was fourteen. Who was fifteen?\n\nLEO\nDr. David Lee. The anesthesiologist at GW. He had to know about the\nBetaseron.\nGetting back to Hoynes...\n\nTOBY\nI'm sorry, Leo, but I need you to look at me right now and tell me that the\ndoctor's\nnot under some kind of surveillance.\n\nLEO\nThe doctor's free to talk to whomever he likes.\n\nTOBY\nWell, I'm sure we're gonna find that out soon enough.\n\nLEO\nHe's not gonna leak it.\n\nTOBY\nSomeone will.\n\nLEO\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nLeo, Hoynes left bread crumbs. He wanted me to find out. A camping trip to\nKillington?\n\nLEO\nThat was a jackass move.\n\nTOBY\nI don't think it was. I think he may be the only one around here who's acting\nresponsibly.\n\nLEO\nTo who?\n\nTOBY\nThe Democratic Party. Seven and a half months to the Iowa caucus, and no\none's been told\nthe President might not be the nominee!\n\nLEO\nHe's gonna run!\n\nTOBY\nNo, he may not have the option, Leo.\n\nLEO\nWhen this story breaks, it'll be because we broke it, and we'll control\nit. And the\npublic will accept it. It's not like it's unprecedented that a President\nconceal health\nissues. [beat] What do you think is gonna happen? I mean it. What do you\nthink is gonna\nhappen?\n\nTOBY\n[clears his throat, stands up and faces Leo] Well, I suppose one of five\nthings.\nThe President can decide not to run. He can run and not win. He can run and\nwin.\n\nLEO\nAnd? What are the other two?\n\nTOBY\nLeo...\n\nLEO\nYou think he's gonna need to resign?\n\nTOBY\nThere's gonna be hearing upon hearing upon hearing.\n\nLEO\nHe hasn't broken a law.\n\nThe door to the Oval Office opens. Leo stands up as Charlie steps outside.\n\nCHARLIE\nThe President's on his way back.\n\nLEO\nThanks.\n\nCharlie goes back inside and shuts the door.\n\nTOBY\nSays you. [beat] You don't have to break the law to get served with articles\nof\nimpeachment.\n\nLEO\nToby, it is never gonna get that far.\n\nTOBY\n[chuckles softly] Write down the exact date and time you said that.\n\nToby goes back inside. Leo stares straight ahead watching him go.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDONNA\n[to Larry and Ed] \"See, the thing about me, is that mine is a dry wit. And\na dry wit,\nlike a fine martini, is best enjoyed...\"\n\nLARRY\nUh-oh...\n\nDONNA\nYeah, nowhere to go there.\n\nSam and Ainsley walk into the room. Sam is carrying the tray of coffee.\n\nED\n[to Sam] What the hell took so long?\n\nSAM\nWe got the coffee but I spilled it coming up the stairs, you know, the first\ncouple of\ntimes. Where's Josh?\n\nDONNA\nYou sent him to get the thing.\n\nSAM\nFor how long? I've had time to spill coffee, you know, a lot.\n\nDONNA\nI'll find him.\n\nDonna stands up and leaves to find Josh.\n\nSAM\nSo, guys...\n\nED\nYeah?\n\nSAM\nWhen I was downstairs, I made a decision. I'm gonna register with the\nRepublican Party,\nand I'll tell you why, if you're curious. It's because they're a freedom-loving\npeople.\n\nAINSLEY\nWe also like beef.\n\nSAM\nYou know, you insist government is depraved for not legislating against what\nwe can see\non the newsstands, or what we can see in an art exhibit, or what we can burn\nin protest,\nor which sex we're allowed to have sex with, or a woman's right to choose,\nbut don't you\ndare try to regulate this deadly weapon I have concealed on me, for that\nwould encroach\nagainst my freedom.\n\nAINSLEY\nYeah? And Democrats believe in free speech as long as it isn't prayer while\nyou're\nstanding in school. You believe in the Freedom of Information Act except if\nyou want to\nfind out if your fourteen-year-old daughter's had an abortion...\n\nSAM\nWe believe in the ERA.\n\nAINSLEY\nWell, go get 'em.\n\nSAM\nHow can you have an objection to something that says...?\n\nAINSLEY\nBecause it's humiliating! A new amendment that we vote on, declaring that\nI am equal\nunder the law to a man. I am mortified to discover there's reason to believe\nI wasn't\nbefore. I am a citizen of this country. I am not a special subset in need\nof your\nprotection. I do not have to have to have my rights handed down to me by a\nbunch of old,\nwhite men. The same Article 14 that protects you, protects me. And I went\nto law school\njust to make sure. And with that, I'm going back down to the mess, because\nI thought I\nmay have seen, there, a peach. [leaves]\n\nSAM\n[to Larry and Ed] I could've countered that, but I'd already moved on to\nother things\nin my head.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nDonna walks down the hall and stops in the doorway to Josh's office. Josh\nis standing\nprecariously on a chair trying to reach the top shelf of his very overloaded\nbookcase.\n\nDONNA\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nOh!\n\nNumerous books and binders cascade to the floor.\n\nJOSH\nWell, that was predictable.\n\nDONNA\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nI'm trying to find that speech Sam said.\n\nJosh steps down, kneels on floor and starts picking up the mess he's made.\n\nDONNA\nYou know, we keep them on computer.\n\nJOSH\nWell, sure, yeah, I suppose.\n\nDONNA\nExcept you don't know how to use a computer.\n\nDonna kneels down on the floor facing Josh and helps him clean up.\n\nJOSH\nRight.\n\nDONNA\nAh, Josh, Josh, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nYes?\n\nDONNA\nJoshua, Josh, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nWhat the hell is happening now?\n\nDONNA\nYou feel, I believe, because you're quite addle-minded, that this job was\nmy second\nchoice.\n\nJOSH\nHey, I'm just grateful we were your last choice.\n\nDONNA\nI'm gonna give you a little gift right now, which you don't deserve.\n\nJOSH\nDonna, if you've got your old Catholic-school uniform on under there, don't\nget me wrong,\nI applaud the thought, but...\n\nDONNA\nOkay, what I need is for you to stop being like, you, for a second.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nDONNA\nWhen I came back, you remember I had a bandage on my ankle?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nI told you I slipped on the ice on the front walk?\n\nJOSH\nYeah. You know why? 'Cause you didn't put down the kitty litter.\n\nDONNA\nI was actually in a car accident.\n\nJOSH\nYou were in a car accident?\n\nDONNA\nIt was...\nJOSH\nSeriously, you were in an accident?\n\nDONNA\nIt was no big deal.\n\nJOSH\nYou told me it was a late thaw.\n\nDONNA\n[smiles] Yes. I did. Anyway, they took me to the hospital and I called him\nand he came\nto get me and on the way he stopped and met some friends of his for a beer.\n\nJOSH\n[incredulously] He stopped on the way to the hospital for a beer?\n\nDONNA\nYes. And that's why I left him. Which was the point of my telling you this. I\nleft him.\nSo stop remembering that. What I remember is that you took me back when you\nhad\nabsolutely no reason to trust me again, and you didn't make fun of me or him,\nand\nyou had every reason to.\n\nJOSH\nDonna...\n\nDONNA\nYou're gonna make fun of him now, aren't you?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nDONNA\n'Cause that's why I didn't tell you in the first place.\n\nJOSH\nI'm not gonna make fun of him.\n\nDONNA\nGood.\n\nJOSH\nBut just what kind of a dumbkes were you...\n\nDONNA\nHe was supposed to meet some of his friends. He stopped on the way to tell\nthem that\nhe couldn't.\n\nJOSH\nAnd had a beer?\n\nDONNA\nDoes this make you feel superior?\n\nJosh looks away and starts to say something, but doesn't.\n\nDONNA\nYes, you are better than my old boyfriend.\n\nJosh stands up and walks toward the door, but stops in the doorway.\n\nJOSH\nI'm just sayin' if you were in an accident, I wouldn't stop for a beer.\n\nDONNA\n[stands up] If you were in an accident, I wouldn't stop for red lights. Thanks\nfor\ntaking me back. [walks out of his office] Oh, and the flowers are beautiful.\n\nJosh stands in the doorway staring after her.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo and Toby sit silently facing each other.\n\nTOBY\nWhy not heightened security?\n\nLEO\nHmm?\n\nTOBY\nAt the airports. Why not heightened security? What's the downside?\n\nLeo and Toby stand as Bartlet enters from the veranda.\n\nBARTLET\n[leaning on a wing chair] Sorry about that.\n\nLEO\nWhat's going on?\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie! [to Leo] I've got to make the call.\n\nCHARLIE\n[enters] Yes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nLet's get Gareth back.\n\nCharlie nods and closes the door. Bartlet sighs and glances at Toby. Toby\nmeets his gaze,\nthen looks away. Bartlet checks his watch. Leo senses the tension, looks at\nToby, then\nlooks at Bartlet.\n\nLEO\nToby was just asking what the downside of going to a security condition was.\n\nBARTLET\nThe scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. The\ncondition\nrequires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are the\ndownside.\n\nCHARLIE\n[knocks] Mr. Gareth.\n\nBARTLET\nThat timed out well.\n\nBartlet sits down in the chair and picks up the phone. Leo and Toby sit on\nthe sofas.\n\nBARTLET\n[into phone] Hal? Okay, let's do it. I'm ordering the airports to a\n2-condition. You'll\nhave it in writing in about five minutes. Thanks. [hangs up, to Leo] I didn't\nknow enough.\n\nTOBY\nI know the feeling.\n\nBARTLET\n[calmly] I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nWould you mind if I ask why not?\n\nBARTLET\n'Cause you're not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to\nclose. Not every\npart of me belongs to you. This was personal. I'm not willing to relinquish\nthat right.\n\nBartlet stands up, walks over behind his desk. Leo and Toby stand.\n\nTOBY\nIt will appear to many, if not most, as fraud. It will appear as if you\ndenied the voters\nan opportunity to decide for themselves. They're generally not willing to\nrelinquish that\nright, either.\n\nBartlet and Leo silently and solemnly look at each other, absorbing Toby's\nwords.\nThe clock ticks softly in the background.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President, at some point in the near future, we're going to have to\nspeak to some\nlawyers.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, that's what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so.\n\nTOBY\n[laughs quietly and icily to himself] It's 17 people, by the way.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry?\n\nTOBY\nYou knew. We weren't counting you. It's 17 people.\n\nBartlet looks at Leo, who looks pained. Bartlet removes his glasses, puts\nthem down on\nhis desk and sighs wearily.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't know. [shakes his head slowly] It may have been unbelievably stupid. It\nmay have\nbeen unthinkably stupid. I don't know.\n\nToby meets Bartlet's gaze.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry. I really am.\n\nLeo is stunned. Toby shifts a bit from side to side. They are all silent\nfor several\nmoments.\n\nTOBY\nI've gotta go in the other room and uh...\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nToby leaves the Oval Office but does not close the door behind him. He pauses\nbriefly in\nthe foyer, then proceeds a few steps across the hall to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM\nand opens the\ndoor. Voices and laughter envelope Toby as he enters the room and sits down\nat the table.\n\nJOSH [OS]\nThat was... I think that's a good one.\n\nThere is general good-humored disagreement with Josh.\n\nSAM [OS]\nToby!\n\nDONNA [OS]\nToby!\n\nJOSH [OS]\nWe're dying here, what do you got?\n\nED [OS]\nUm, okay. So, the President was asked to pick tonight's menu and he says,\n\"Oh, just\nserve anything you want except lame duck.\"\n\nLARRY [OS]\nToby, listen, listen to this.\n\nTOBY\n[weakly] Okay.\n\nLARRY [OS]\nSo the President says, \"I know times are tough. The NASDAQ just filed for\nnot-for-profit\nstatus.\"\n\nSAM [OS]\nToby.\n\nSam tosses Toby his ball, which he catches. Toby looks pained, but continues\nto listen\nto joke suggestions.\n\nAINSLEY [OS]\nOkay, what about the one about the Pentagon?\n\nOver Toby's shoulder, framed by the French doors of the Roosevelt Room,\nBartlet signs a\ndocument as Charlie looks on. Leo steps into view, with a stern look on his\nface, and\ncloses the door to the Oval Office.\n\nJOSH [OS]\nOkay, uh, you have to try and imagine that the President is saying it. Tell\nme if you\nthink this is funny.\n\nA single sound echoes the opening rhythm of Toby bouncing his ball against\nthe wall.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nBartlet is talking to an advisor.\n\nBARTLET\nI couldn't disagree more, Cal. As long as these people are funding their\npublic school\ndistricts with property taxes, neither the value of the schools nor the\nvalue of their\nproperty is going to go up. It's a vicious circle.

Cochran, Gates, Solomon,\nTribbey.\nWhy can't I keep a head lawyer around here?\n\nLEO\n'Cause they all show up thinking they're going to be a counselor to the\nPresident and\nyou never let them in.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't like new people.\n\nLEO\nOliver Babish isn't a new person. You know each other. Your kids know each\nother.\nYou built hospitals together. He was Midwest Finance Chairman on the\ncampaign.\n\nBARTLET\nNever played chess, though, have we?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nSee?\n\nLEO\nYou're scared of Babish.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, like you're not.\n\nLEO\nNo, because we are both men of Chicago.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat is it with people from Chicago that they're so happy to have been born\nthere?\nI meet so many people who can't wait to tell me they're from Chicago and\nwhen I meet\nthem, they're living anywhere but Chicago.\n\nLEO\nYou wouldn't understand.\n\nBARTLET\nHe looks down his nose at me 'cause I'm not a lawyer.\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nI didn't go to law school. I got a Ph.D. in economics instead.\n\nLEO\nYour parents were very proud.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, and all that happened was I won a Nobel Prize and got elected President\nso I guess\nthat decision didn't really pay off.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nShould I run back and get my Nobel Prize?\n\nLEO\nI think he knows you've got one.\n\nLeo and Bartlet enter THE OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, which has a\nhuge waiting\nroom. The room behind it is huge also, and there are bags in it, fully packed.\n\nBARTLET\nGuy's been here three months he's got a nicer office than I do.\n\nLEO\nHe's got a nicer office than I do.\n\nBARTLET\nThat matters less to me.\n\nOliver Babish heads out to meet them.\n\nOLIVER\nGood morning, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Oliver.\n\nOLIVER\nCome on in.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat are the bags for?\n\nOLIVER\nI was just heading out on vacation.\n\nBARTLET\nOh... oh, gosh.

Is\nit possible\nfor someone with relapsing/remitting MS to experience an attack that would\ninclude\ntemporary loss of proper brain function but exclude any physical symptoms?\n\nLeo and Bartlet exchange glances.\n\nOLIVER\nLet me put it another way. Is it possible you could be sitting in this room,\nhave an\nattack, and I don't know it?\n\nBARTLET\nI think what you're asking is, Is it possible I could be sitting in the\nSituation Room,\nhave an attack, and nobody knows it.\n\nOLIVER\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nYes.

Is there\ntime now?\n\nBARTLET\nWell, the Mexican economy crashed, an oil tanker busted up about 120 miles\nfrom here and\n13 percent of Americans are living in poverty.

I love it.\n\nAINSLEY\nIsn't it great?\n\nSAM\nNo, but there's a reason I like it.\n\nAINSLEY\nWell, it's beautiful.\n\nSAM\nBut there's another reason, hang on.\n\nAINSLEY\nIt's called \"Air on a G String.\" Could that be...?\n\nSAM\nYes. Thank you.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhat do you need?\n\nSAM\nA lawyer.\n\nAINSLEY\nWell, you came to the wrong place.\n\nSAM\nSeriously.\n\nAINSLEY\nAre you in trouble?\n\nSAM\nNo, I'm not. I just want to ask you some questions. You've been covering\nthe Attorneys\nGeneral for Maryland and Delaware this morning, right?\n\nAINSLEY\nOn the oil spill.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nAINSLEY\nThey'll hold a joint press conference this afternoon to announce that they're\nseeking\ndamages.\n\nSAM\nHow much?\n\nAINSLEY\nWho can say at this point, but if I had to guess I'd say in the area of $100\nmillion for\ncleanup costs, probably another 3 or $400 million punitive. I know how you\nfeel about\nthese things, trust me. Kensington's going to pay it through the nose.\n\nSAM\nNo, they're not.\n\nAINSLEY\nI think you're wrong.\n\nSAM\nSomebody's going to pay. It's not going to be them.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou think their liability shield is that strong?\n\nSAM\nI do.\n\nAINSLEY\nHow do you know?\n\nSAM\n'Cause I'm the one who bought them the boat. I bought the Indio for them\nwhen I was at\nGage Whitney.\n\nAINSLEY\nWow. [beat] Talk about your chickens coming home to roost.\n\nSAM\nYeah, but what I was thinking was this. I know this is going to sound crazy\nbut I was\nthinking, if I could be deposed for the plaintiffs...\n\nAINSLEY\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nBecause... Look, I was very proud of myself for making such a great deal\nand it really\nsealed it for me with the partners and they were about to make me one. And\nit really\ndidn't bother me that the boat was cheap for a reason. But then, at the 11th\nhour,\nI had a change of heart. For whatever reason, I had a change of heart and\nI told them\nthe boat wasn't good enough, particularly with regards to the steering and\nnavigation\nsystems, which, of course, they already knew, and I suggested they spend\nmore money,\nand they said...\n\nAINSLEY\nStop talking right now!\n\nSAM\n$11 million extra dollars.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nThey laughed me out of the room.\n\nAINSLEY\nStop talking, or I'm walking out. [beat] You know better. Neither you nor\nyour clients\nabdicated attorney/client privilege when you left Gage. If you gave that\ndeposition,\nyou'd be disbarred. And even if you were willing to be disbarred, there's\nno judge in\nthe country who'd allow privileged testimony.\n\nSAM\nAinsley, unless a company like this is forced to fork over so much money\nthey don't want\nto go on living -- unless they're compelled to pay $500 million -- there's\nno incentive\nfor them to pay the extra 11 million to make the boat safer.\n\nAINSLEY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nAll right. It was just an idea.\n\nAINSLEY\nHey, you never know. With the liability shield? Maybe you're not as good as\nyou think.\n\nSAM\nYeah, I am.\n\nSam exits.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nMrs. Landingham walks in as Charlie works at another desk.\n\nMRS.

He might have. I don't know.\n\nC.J.\nIt's important.\n\nDONNA\nI'll try to remember.\n\nC.J.\n'Cause somebody might've overheard you talking to him.\n\nDONNA\nYeah, there's so much to remember. (sighs)\n\nC.J.\nAre you okay?\n\nDONNA\nIt's just... I'll be fine.\n\nC.J.\nAnd... and you yourself didn't talk to anyone, did you?\n\nDonna looks up guiltily at C.J.\n\nC.J.\nDonna?\n\nDONNA\nC.J., I can't...\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nDONNA\nI can't lie like this anymore.\n\nC.J.\nAre you saying it was you?\n\nDONNA\nI feel horrible. I should've said something before, but I was afraid of what\nyou'd...\n\nC.J.\nNo, it's okay.\n\nDONNA\nNo, let me get this off my chest. It was me. I called Terry Cashin.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nDONNA\nI don't know. Why does anybody do anything?\n\nC.J.\n[in disbelief] What are you talking about?\n\nDONNA\nI'm a madwoman, C.J. And it doesn't stop with the leak.\n\nC.J.\n[horrified] What do you mean?\n\nDONNA\nCall the authorities. Send them to my parent's house in Madison.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nDONNA\nThey'll find the Lindbergh baby in the basement.\n\nC.J.\n[finally catching up] Okay...

JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - CONTINUOUS\n\nJOSH\nDid you confess?\n\nDONNA\nShe didn't let me get to Whittaker Chambers and the secret pumpkin.\n\nJOSH\nYou got a phone call while you were in there.\n\nDONNA\nFrom who?\n\nJOSH\nEurope in 1939.\n\nDONNA\nYeah?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, I jotted it down. Apparently they're at war, but we've taken a firm\nstand as an\nisolationist nation and refused to get involved. Our resources are our own\nand their\nproblems are on the other side of the world. Though, they do have problems. It\nsounds\nto me from what they said on the phone that France, Austria, and England\nare getting\nabsolutely pounded by the Germans, and with no end in sight. They say that\nby 1941\nthey're gonna desperately need our help if they have any chance of\nsurvival. But I think\nthey're just being hysterical. This son of a customs agent with the Charlie\nChaplin\nmustache ain't going anywhere. But there's no telling that to Franklin\nRoosevelt, who's\ntrying to convince his country they need to get involved. That's why he came\nup with this.\n\nThey are now in JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh hands her a book.\n\nDONNA\nAn eighth-grade social studies textbook?\n\nJOSH\nTurn to the page I flagged.\n\nDONNA\nThe Lend-Lease Act.\n\nJOSH\nYeah. Simply put, a loan of arms to Russia and Britain, with the understanding\nthat\nthey'd pay us back when the war was over. And he said this, he said,\n\"If your neighbor's\nhouse is on fire, you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose.\" Frank\nKelly in\nSouth Carolina wouldn't... There are too many things in the world we can't\ndo. Mexico's\non fire. Why help them? Because we can.\n\nDONNA\nDid they agree to the money?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDonna hands Josh the book. They both smile at each other.\n\nDONNA\nOkay. [leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\nC.J. is once again seated behind her desk. Zach is seated across from her.\n\nZACH\nYou shouldn't feel bad about this.\n\nC.J.\nEveryone hates me.\n\nZACH\nNah, they'll get over it.\n\nC.J.\nYou think?\n\nZACH\nSure. You're just doing your job.\n\nC.J.\nThat's exactly right.\n\nZACH\nAnd this is really important.\n\nC.J.\nYou're the first person who's understood that.\n\nZACH\nYou mind if I give you a suggestion that may make this go faster?\n\nC.J.\nSure.\n\nZACH\n[wryly] If you dunk the suspect in a deep well of water, and they drown,\nit means they're\nnot a witch.\n\nC.J.\nAll right, that's it!

Zach throws his arms open as if\nin\nreligious ecstasy.\n\nZACH\nI saw Lizzie Proctor speaking with the devil!\n\nC.J.\nShut up! (walks out into the hallway)\n\nCUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY\nSam is seated on the sofa reading a report. Toby is sitting in a chair.\n\nSAM\n720,000 gallons covering close to 100 square miles. 10,000 blue and horseshoe\ncrabs are\ndead, so that's a $25 million dollar industry that can start looking for\njobs at the\nlocal Dairy Queen. 12,500 starfish, flounder and bass. $342 million estimated\nlost to the\ntourism economy based on beach communities. You ever wonder why you never\nhear anything\nabout a boatload of Honda Civics spilling into the ocean?\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nWere you listening?\n\nTOBY\nYeah... No. I'm sorry, no.\n\nC.J. strides through the door looking very determined.\n\nC.J.\nExcuse me, Sam, would you mind?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nSam gets up and leaves. C.J. slams the door behind him.\n\nC.J.\nIt's me, okay? I am Spartacus.\n\nTOBY\nLook ...\n\nC.J.\nIt was a leak. Leaks happen. They've happened since the beginning of time. In\nthis\nWhite House, in every White House. There's no malicious intent. Things get\nout.\nIt's a company town. Everybody talks to everybody, and junior staffers try\nto impress\nreporters by showing they're in the know. There is no group of people this\nlarge in\nthe world that can keep a secret. I find it comforting. It's how I know for\nsure the\ngovernment isn't covering up aliens in New Mexico. (pause) Toby, I've issued\na blanket\nemail to 1,100 staffers about the incident. I've asked the President to let\nme make a\nclarification for tomorrow morning. I've seen to it it'll be on page one. We're\nnot\ngonna lose an inch of ground in the negotiation.\n\nTOBY\n[wearily] No, we're not.\n\nC.J.\nNo, we're not. And you knew that since this morning.\n\nTOBY\nYes, I did.\n\nC.J.\nYeah. So what's this about?\n\nA lengthy silence falls between them. Toby gets up and stands behind his\ndesk.\n\nTOBY\nThis is small potatoes. I want to know, when the big potatoes come, are we\nup for it?\n\nC.J.\nBig potatoes? Toby, we ran for election. We lived through Leo and booze,\nSam and\nprostitutes, India and Pakistan, Columbia and a failed rescue mission. Are\nthere\nbigger potatoes someplace?\n\nTOBY\n[quietly, not meeting her gaze] No.\n\nC.J.\n(sharply, looking very concerned) Toby?\n\nToby looks up at her, and shifts his weight slightly from side to side.\n\nTOBY\nYeah?\n\nC.J.\nWhy are you lying to me?\n\nTOBY\nI'm not. (clears his throat) Thanks for doing that stuff today. (more\nshifting)\nIt was...\n\nC.J. stares at him silently, looking extremely unconvinced.\n\nTOBY\nThanks.\n\nC.J. turns and leaves without saying anything. Toby watches her go and sighs.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT\nCharlie is seated on a bench with his hands in his lap. Bartlet walks toward\nhim,\nthrough pools of light, from the direction of the Residence. Charlie stands\nup.\n\nBARTLET\nSit down. Don't be scared.\n\nThey both sit down on the bench. Charlie stares straight ahead without\nlooking at Bartlet.\nBartlet turns toward Charlie.\n\nBARTLET\nMy youngest daughter's got a big mouth.\n\nA lengthy silence falls between them. Bartlet looks uncomfortable.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, she doesn't, sir. She wanted me to be on the lookout for certain physical\nsigns so\nI could tell the First Lady.\n\nSeveral moments pass while Bartlet absorbs this information. He sighs.\n\nBARTLET\nWe won't discuss this any more for the time being. It'll be public soon\nenough. And the\nmore conversations you have with me, the more lawyers you're gonna have to\ntalk to, and\nthey bill in an hour what you take home in a week, so we won't discuss it\nexcept to say\nthis you're gonna be subpoenaed. I'm confident in your loyalty to me. I'm\nconfident in\nyour love for me. If you lie to protect me, if you lie just once, if you\nlie just a\nlittle, if you lie 'cause you can't stand what's happening to me and the\npeople making\nit happen, if you ever, ever lie...\n\nCharlie finally looks over at Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\n...you're finished with me, you understand?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nSay you understand.\n\nCHARLIE\nI understand, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nGo back to work.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nThey both stand up. Bartlet walks toward the Oval Office.\n\nCHARLIE\nIs there anything you need?\n\nBARTLET\n(turns around) I need you to go to law school and graduate as soon as humanly\npossible.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCharlie turns to go inside. Bartlet walks toward the entrance to the Oval\nOffice.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nOliver stands in the middle of the room and turns as Bartlet enters.\n\nOLIVER\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I've got good news for you, Oliver. Turns out I didn't do everything\nright after\nall. Zoey had to fill out a family history form for Georgetown and because\nshe was 17,\na parent had to sign it.\n\nOLIVER\nAnd she left off the MS?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nOLIVER\nAnd you signed it?\n\nBARTLET\nI'd give anything if I had. It was Lady Macbeth. (pause) There's a bad moon\nrising,\nOliver. We both know it. They're gonna take me out for a walk.\n\nBartlet sits down on the sofa. Oliver remains standing.\n\nBARTLET\nThis isn't what you signed up for. Leo begged you to take this job. This\nisn't what you\nsigned up for. If you leave, I'd appreciate it if you did it now, so it\ndoesn't look\nlike my lawyer bailed on me when the rain starts. No one's gonna hold it\nagainst you.\n\nOLIVER\nWell, I appreciate that, Mr. President. (pause) If I stay, will you do\nexactly what I\ntell you to do?\n\nBARTLET\nI guess it depends.\n\nOLIVER\nNo, I'm afraid it can't depend, sir.\n\nA lengthy silence falls between them. Bartlet stands up, his hands in his\npockets, and\nwalks slowly toward his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat would my first step be?\n\nOLIVER\nFirst, tell your staff.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nOLIVER\nThen, decide how to make a public announcement.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nOLIVER\nThen order the Attorney General to appoint a Special Prosecutor. Not just\nany Special\nProsecutor - the most blood-spitting, Bartlet-hating Republican in the Bar.\n\nOliver walks slowly but purposefully toward Bartlet.\n\nOLIVER\nHe's gonna have an unlimited budget and a staff like an army. The new slogan\naround\nhere is gonna be \"bring it on.\" He's gonna have access to every piece of\npaper you\never touched. If you invoke executive privilege one time, I'm gone. An\nassistant DA\nin Ducksworth wants to take your deposition, you're on the next plane. A\nfreshman\nCongressman wants your testimony, you'll sit in his kitchen. They wanna drag\nyou to\nThe Hague and charge you with war crimes, what do we say?\n\nBartlet stares silently at Oliver for several moments.\n\nBARTLET\n(quietly) Bring it on.\n\nOLIVER\n[nods ever so slightly] I'll be in my office for a while if you need me.\n\nOliver turns and leaves.

I\nthink twelve\nmillion dollars.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, but the problem is the law says that those transfers are subject to\napproval by\nvarious House committees, each of which has a chairman elected with the\neight million\ndollars Tobacco spent in the last election. And even if the transfers were\napproved,\nit wouldn't matter, 'cause twelve million isn't gonna get it done.\n\nLEO\nNeither is thirty million.\n\nJOSH\nThen let's give 'em more.\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nLEO\n'Cause we're gonna lose.\n\nJOSH\nSo you give 'em enough to win.\n\nLEO\nWe'd have to liquidate the Grand Tetons.\n\nJOSH\nThey're saying thirty million and I think it's a steal at twice the price.\n\nLeo is reading his phone messages and only half listening to Josh at this\npoint.\n\nLEO\nStaff it out to some people and report to me on it in what...?\n\nJOSH\nTwo, three days?\n\nLEO\nGood.\n\nJOSH\nI'm going out to the airport.\n\nJosh stands up and walks toward the door.\n\nLEO\n[looks up from his messages] All right... Do a job.\n\nJOSH\n[turns to look at Leo] Yeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\nSam walks into the room. Several members of the Progressive Caucus - including\nHenry,\nHelen, Bruce and Lewis - are standing around the table waiting for him.\n\nSAM\nHi.\n\nHENRY\nHey, Sam.\n\nSAM\nHenry, Helen. Hey, Bruce.\n\nBRUCE\nHow you doing, Sam?\n\nEveryone except Sam and Henry sit.\n\nSAM\nLewis. We just have a few minutes, right?\n\nLEWIS\nThere's a caucus.\n\nSAM\nWell, you've already heard the good news. The CBO, when they project eight\nyears out,\nhas the budget surplus coming in 200 billion dollars lower than we thought.\n\nCAUCUS MEMBERS\nThat's great.\n\nSAM\nYeah, okay, there's something wrong with all of us, but that's for a different\ntime.\n[finally takes a seat] What I wanted to mention was Jane Gentry and Richard\nWill say\nyou guys want a line in the Chicago draft.\n\nHENRY\n\"Jet planes and swimming pools.\"\n\nSAM\nYeah, that \"our opponents want to help the rich pay for bigger swimming\npools and faster\nprivate jets.\"\n\nHELEN\nYeah, hit 'em hard.\n\nSAM\nWell, we are hitting them hard, but I'm not gonna use the line.\n\nHENRY\nWhy not?\n\nSAM\nFirst of all, it's bad writing.\n\nHENRY\nWhat's wrong with it? [sits]\n\nSAM\nIt sounds like it was written by a high school girl.\n\nHELEN\nIs there something wrong with the way a woman writes?\n\nSAM\nThere usually is when she's in high school.\n\nHENRY\nSam!\n\nSAM\nIt's not the writing. Come on, Henry! \"Faster private jets and swimming\npools?\"\n\nHENRY\nWe can take out the heavy bats now.\n\nSAM\nAnd do what with them?\n\nHELEN\nThe line works.\n\nSAM\nSo does \"How about 'em Cowboys?\" when you're playing a club in Dallas,\nbut the line\nisn't gonna change the mind of anyone who doesn't already agree with us.\n\nHENRY\nSam, are you in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy?\n\nSAM\nI am not. I am in favor of tax cuts for those for whom it will do the most\ngood - and\nthat's a tough enough battle - and it looks like, all of a sudden, we've\ngot a fair\nfight. But I'm not talking about policy. I'm talking about rhetoric, and\nthe men you\nwork for need to dial it down to five.\n\nSeveral of the Caucus members exchange annoyed glances.\n\nSAM\nHenry, last fall, every time your boss got on the stump and said, \"It's time\nfor the\nrich to pay their fair share,\" I hid under a couch and changed my name. I\nleft Gage\nWhitney making $400,000 a year, which means I paid twenty-seven times the\nnational\naverage in income tax. I paid my fair share, and the fair share of twenty-six\nother\npeople. And I'm happy to 'cause that's the only way it's gonna work, and\nit's in my\nbest interest that everybody be able to go to schools and drive on roads,\nbut I don't\nget twenty-seven votes on Election Day. The fire department doesn't come to\nmy house\ntwenty-seven times faster and the water doesn't come out of my faucet\ntwenty-seven times\nhotter. The top one percent of wage earners in this country pay for twenty-two\npercent\nof this country. Let's not call them names while they're doing it, is all\nI'm saying.\n\nHELEN\nYou're not using the line?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nHELEN\nOr anything like it?\n\nSAM\nNo. And I hope you'll make it clear to your people that this has nothing to\ndo with\ndiluting our position or cozying up to Republicans.\n\nHENRY\n[sarcastically] No, why would they think that?\n\nLEWIS\nWe've got a caucus.\n\nThe Caucus members get up and start to leave. Sam remains seated.\n\nSAM\n[over his shoulder] I know plenty of women who can write, Helen. I know\nwomen who can\nblow the walls of brick buildings. This sounds like a girl.\n\nHelen doesn't respond, just stares at him for a moment, and leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. NATIONAL AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY\n\nANNOUNCER\n...Airlines Flight 1106, arriving from Los Angeles, is now in Gate Six...\n\nJoey Lucas and a new interpreter, DALE BRACKET, walk through the terminal\namidst waves\nof people.

How you doing?\n\nJOEY\nHey!\n\nJOSH\n[to Dale] I'm Josh Lyman.\n\nDALE BRACKET\nDale Bracket. [They shake hands.]\n\nJOSH\nWhat happened to Kenny?\n\nJOEY [DALE]\nHe's on vacation.\n\nJOSH\n[to Dale] So you're the substitute interpreter?\n\nDALE\nYeah.\n\nJOEY\n[pleased] You came here to pick me up at the airport?\n\nJOSH\nNot exactly. Uh, Dale, I'm gonna ask you to wait over her, okay?... Uh,\nJoey, you're\ngonna read my lips, and if I can't understand what you're saying, you'll\nwrite it down,\nall right?\n\nJoey nods, looking perplexed but amenable.\n\nJOEY\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\n[to Dale] Excuse us.\n\nJosh and Joey walk away from Dale.\n\nJOSH\nDale?\n\nJosh looks over his shoulder at Dale.\n\nJOEY\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nPretty good-looking for an interpreter, wouldn't you say?\n\nJOEY\nHe's good-looking for anybody.\n\nJOSH\nDale Bracket?\n\nJOEY\nYes.\n\nJOSH\n[sarcastically] He's not a television detective?\n\nJOEY\nWe can't talk about this in the car?\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry?\n\nJOEY\n[a bit louder] We can't talk about this in the car?\n\nJOSH\nYou're not getting in the car.\n\nJOEY\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\n'Cause you're getting back on a plane in an hour and ten minutes.\n\nThey sit down at a table in the middle of a bar that is along the side of\nthe terminal.\nJoey, increasingly confused, drops her bags next to her chair, Josh sighs\nheavily.\n\nJOSH\nAll right, if we sit like this, can Dale Bracket, PI, read my lips?\n\nJOEY\n[slightly annoyed] No.\n\nJOSH\nOkay... You're not talking to me about an agriculture poll.\n\nJOEY\nNo kidding.\n\nJOSH\nYou guessed that?\n\nJOEY\nYou think we're eating more beets?\n\nJOSH\nWell, we are, but... that's not important.\n\nJOEY\nWhat's important?\n\nWAITRESS\nHi, what can I get for you?\n\nJoey grabs a napkin and writes on it while Josh orders.\n\nJOSH\nUh, cranberry juice and club soda...and, um, I'll have a large glass of ice\nwater.\n\nJoey slides the napkin across the table to Josh. She's written, \"What's\nimportant?\"\n\nJOSH\nI told Leo McGarry that we could trust you, and Toby backed me up.\n\nJOEY\n[nodding] What's important?\n\nJOSH\n[swallows apprehensively] Eight years ago, the President was diagnosed with\nan illness\nthat was never disclosed.\n\nJoey absorbs this information pretty calmly. She writes on the napkin again\nand Josh\npicks it up. She's written, \"Is it serious?\"\n\nJOSH\n[softly] Yes.\n\nJOEY\nWhat is it?\n\nJosh stares at her as he signs the letters \"M\" and \"S.\"\n\nWAITRESS\nCranberry and club... and a large glass of ice water.\n\nJoey looks sad and concerned, but doesn't say anything as the waitress sets\ntheir drinks\non the table.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE - DAY\nThere's a knock on the door and it opens. Oliver's aide steps into the room.&gt;\n\nAIDE\nExcuse me... The First Lady.\n\nOLIVER\nThank you.\n\nAbbey nonchalantly but resolutely strides into the office.\n\nABBEY\nOliver.\n\nOLIVER\nGood afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet. [They shake hands.]\n\nABBEY\nHow are you?\n\nOLIVER\nI'm fine, thank you.\n\nABBEY\n[paces nervously] You know, I haven't been in this office since you moved in.\nIt looks great.\n\nOLIVER\nThank you.\n\nOliver paces a bit, then stops and turns to face her. Abbey keeps pacing.\n\nABBEY\nI haven't come in here because it seems that every time I do, there's a new\nWhite House\nCounsel. I think Leo keeps them in the basement, like those two ladies in\nArsenic and\nOld Lace.\n\nOLIVER\nYeah?\n\nABBEY\nAnyway, the President is very glad you're here, particularly in this time\nof nonsense.\n\nOLIVER\nMa'am, would you mind if I asked you a few questions?\n\nABBEY\n[allows just a bit of a nervous smile to appear] I'm not as experienced in\nthis as the\nsenior staff... I've read a book about Daniel Webster. I've read a book\nabout Benjamin\nDisraeli. It seems the little experience I do have is with dead lawyers.\n\nOLIVER\nJust out of curiosity, ma'am, how'd they die?\n\nABBEY\nIf you're under the impression that you're the fifth White House Counsel\ninstead of the\nfirst White House Counsel because of me, you're mistaken, Oliver.\n\nOLIVER\nI wasn't under that impression, but I think we should stick to the matter,\nif it's all\nright with you.\n\nABBEY\n[sighs] You want to ask me some questions?\n\nOLIVER\nYes, ma'am.\n\nABBEY\nAbout Zoey's health form.\n\nOLIVER\nYep.\n\nABBEY\n[shrugs slightly] It was a form. It asked for, among other things, the\nfamily's medical\nhistory. It was left blank. It was a form - it was one of many forms. I\nsigned it without\nreading it.\n\nOLIVER\nWas anyone else in the room when you signed it?\n\nABBEY\nOh, it was over a year ago. I really don't remember.\n\nOLIVER\nWas the President in the room?\n\nABBEY\nI really don't remember.\n\nOLIVER\nYou understand that when I ask the President that question, he's gonna tell\nthe truth?\n\nABBEY\n[testily] And I imagine the President will also resent your implication that\nI didn't\njust do the same.\n\nOLIVER\nSo the President wasn't in the room when you signed it?\n\nABBEY\n[exasperated, shaking her head] I don't remember; he doesn't remember.\n\nOLIVER\nMrs. Bartlet...\n\nABBEY\nOliver, you have kids, there are forms. School trips and soccer and band\nuniforms and\nreport cards and notes to get out of gym. You've signed those forms for your\nkids.\n\nOLIVER\nTheir mother usually signs them.\n\nABBEY\nAnd so do I. And, by the way, when you're the daughter of the Governor of\nNew Hampshire\nand the President of the United States, there's a lot more forms on top of\nthat.\n\nOLIVER\nI understand.\n\nABBEY\n[a bit sarcastically] Do you?\n\nOLIVER\nYes. But a lawyer half my size, while cross-examining you during deposition,\nwill say\nthe following, he will say \"Mrs. Bartlet, do you have an M.D. from Harvard?\"\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nOLIVER\n\"Are you board-certified in Internal Medicine?\"\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nOLIVER\n\"Are you board-certified in Thoracic Surgery?\"\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nOLIVER\n\"Are you an Adjunct Professor of Thoracic Surgery at Harvard Medical School?\"\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nOLIVER\n\"Are you on the staff of Boston Mercy Hospital and Columbia Presbyterian?\"\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nOLIVER\n\"Have you been practicing medicine for twenty-six years?\"\n\nABBEY\n[annoyed] Yes.\n\nOLIVER\n\"Are you not able to recognize a standard medical history form when it is\nput in front\nof your face?\"\n\nABBEY\nI didn't read it! I didn't think it was important!\n\nOLIVER\nWhat else have you signed without thinking it was important? Prescriptions?\n\nABBEY\nNo!\n\nOLIVER\nPatient instructions?\n\nABBEY\nNo!\n\nOLIVER\nOh, so just this?\n\nABBEY\nOliver, I am not an expert in the diseases of the central nervous system,\nbut I can tell\nyou that MS is not hereditary. The President's condition has absolutely no\nrelevance to\nZoey's health status.\n\nOLIVER\nWell, now you're changing your story, Mrs. Bartlet.\n\nABBEY\nNo, I'm not.\n\nOLIVER\nDid you sign it because you were absent-minded or did you sign it because\nyou knew best?\n\nABBEY\nI signed it 'cause...I just signed it...It was a form...And I think making\na big thing\nout of it is what makes it into a big thing!\n\nOLIVER\nReally?\n\nABBEY\nAnd I'm not a hundred percent sure that that's not what you're going for.\n\nOLIVER\nWhy would I want to make it a big thing?\n\nABBEY\nBecause defending the President in primetime looks good on a resume.\n\nOLIVER\nWell, I've got a pretty good-looking resume already, Mrs. Bartlet. And it's\nnot a big\nthing because I say so, ma'am; it's a big thing. You're gonna get all the\nquestions I\njust asked you, and quite a few more. And then they're gonna ask the President\nif he was\nin the room when you signed it. And that's when he's gonna give everyone's\nfavorite\nanswer from a President who has just announced that he has MS: \"I don't\nremember.\"\n\nOliver sighs, walks to his desk chair and sits down. Abbey remains standing\nwith her back\nturned to him. She looks a bit shaken. Neither of them say anything for\nseveral moments.\n\nOLIVER\nWhen are you gonna go public?\n\nABBEY\n[faintly] Probably in a week. They're still strategizing.\n\nOLIVER\nProbably a live interview on the networks?\n\nABBEY\nYeah. [turns to look at him]\n\nOLIVER\nJim Lehrer, Tim Russert, Barbara Walters... you... somebody... the President\nsitting\nin a den.\n\nABBEY\nYeah.\n\nOLIVER\nFollowed by a live conference.\n\nABBEY\nThey're working on the strategy.\n\nOLIVER\n[imitating what the President might say] \"I regret that I concealed my\ncondition from\nthe public. I regret the appearance that I tried to deceive the voters in\norder to win\nan election.\"\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nOLIVER\nAnd if we don't make it a big thing, they won't make it a big thing? [pause]\nMrs. Bartlet,\nI'm not sure you have an appropriate appreciation of the size of what happens\nnext.\n\nAbbey stares at Oliver. She looks completely shell-shocked, but does not\nrespond.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT.

Probably a live interview, followed by a press conference. So\nwe need to\nknow what we're talking about. Joey, we need you to put a poll in the\nfield. You got to\ncome up with a model that gets us the answers we need without asking the\nquestions we\ncan't ask. You gotta come up with the model by yourself, you got to break\ndown the\nresults by yourself. Not even the callers can understand the questions\nthey're asking.\nAnd you got to do it all in 96 hours.

We saw to it\nthere was a\nfree election, and Dessalines won!\n\nROBBIE\nIf we grant asylum to we'd officially be in a standoff with Bazan.\n\nJAKE\nThe best way for Bazan to elevate his stature in Haiti is to stage a standoff\nwith\nthe U.S.\n\nROBBIE\nPlus Bazan can surround the embassy, saying he's searching for a wanted\ncriminal,\nand obviously he can take everyone in the embassy hostage.\n\nIn the background, Charlie walks to a man and whispers in his ear, motioning\nto a phone.\n\nLEO\nMr. President, there will never be real elections in Haiti if the military\nthinks it\ncan simply kill the winner.

If he's there it's a breathing\ndemonstration\nthat he signed off on the president's health and joined the ticket.\n\nC.J.\nAnd he'll get bombarded with questions about what he did or didn't know,\nthe press corps\nwill impanel themselves as a grand jury.\n\nSAM\nThen let them, C.J.!

Uh... I'm not a litigator and I don't work at the Justice Department,\nand\nthere's a reason why both those things are true...but I wouldn't think it'd\nbe that\nhard to prove that the tobacco companies have lied since we already know\nthey did!\n\nROSSITTER\nEvery Surgeon General since 1964 has warned the public about smoking and\nsince 1966\nthrough a Congressional mandate a pack of cigarettes has to carry a warning\nlabel.\nTurning around now and saying 'we've been had' is frankly ridiculous.\n\nJOSH\nAre you saying that people who start smoking and get addicted to nicotine\nare too\nstupid to live?\n\nROSSITTER\nNo, I'm saying they're too stupid to be protected by the courts.\n\nJOSH\nToo stupid to be... Every day, the Justice Department uncovers the evidence\nthat\ncigarette companies knew far better than the rest of us, that smoking causes\ndeath\nand disease.

Leo and Toby sit down in chairs.\n\nJOSH\nKalmbach's not gonna let it come to a vote in the subcommittee, which at\nthe moment is fine,\n'cause if he did, it'd be 8-7 against.\n\nLEO\nParty lines?\n\nJOSH\n[sits down on sofa] No...We have Stacy and Miner but Warren and Rossitter\nare voting against.\nThey have ideological problems with the case...What do you wanna do now?\n\nLEO\nStick some dynamite up Warren and Rossitter's ass.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, the problem is, Rossitter sits on the Judiciary Committee and I don't\nknow how many\nenemies on Judiciary we wanna make right now.\n\nToby listens with his head in one hand.\n\nLEO\n[firmly] Both of you listen. We're not gonna stop, soften, detour, postpone,\ncircumvent,\nobfuscate, or trade a single one of our goals to allow for whatever\nextracurricular nonsense\nis coming our way in the next few days, weeks, and months.\n\nC.J. comes in and sits down while Leo is talking.\n\nTOBY\n[mildly annoyed] When did we decide this?\n\nLEO\n[pauses] Just now.

They pick the interviewer, it's carried on all the networks and CNN. I\ngive it to\nthem ten hours before.\n\nTOBY\nAnd that's followed by a press conference.\n\nC.J.\nThere isn't another step we can take until we know what the President's\nintentions are.\nWe need a discussion, and I hate to sound shrill, but it can't wait another\nnight.\n\nTOBY\nWe're having a discussion.\n\nC.J.\nWhen?\n\nJOSH\nTonight.\n\nC.J.\nReally?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nThat's great.\n\nThe door opens and Sam walks in. He doesn't sit down.\n\nSAM\nGood evening.\n\nLEO\nSam, what do you know?\n\nSAM\nI know that fluid accumulating in the semicircular canals of the\nvestibulo-cochlear nerve is\nusually what'll account for dizziness.\n\nLeo, Toby, and Josh all roll their eyes with mild exasperation and empathy.\n\nSAM\nLeo, I want to state right here, right now, in terms so plain and clear as\nto command\ntheir assent...\n\nLEO\n[wearily] We're having a meeting tonight.\n\nSAM\nThe whole country's gonna assume he's not running when he announces the thing.\n\nLEO\n[wearily, but a bit louder] We're having a meeting.\n\nSAM\nThe press is gonna assume...\n\nLEO\n[emphatically] We're having a meeting!\n\nSAM\nReally?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nThat's great.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nC.J. stares blankly at Josh and Toby, who both glance at Leo.\n\nLEO\n[glances at his watch] Why doesn't everybody grab something to eat, be back\nat 9:00, and\nyou'll get called to come over to the Residence.\n\nC.J. and Toby stand up and leave, along with Sam.\n\nLEO\nJosh, walk out with me.\n\nJosh stands up. Leo walks behind his desk to gather up a few things.\n\nLEO\nI mean it - set one off under these guys.\n\nJOSH\nHow about I have C.J. make a statement at her briefing?\n\nLEO\n[looks up] A strong statement.\n\nAs they walk out of the office into the hallway, they toss out possible\nlanguage for the statement.\n\nJOSH\n\"The President calls on Congress to fund the Justice Department's tobacco\nlawsuit at the\nlevels necessary to continue this litigation.\"\n\nLEO\n\"The American people deserve their day in court.\"\n\nJOSH\n[more animated] \"And this Administration won't sit on the bench while well-fed\nmembers of\nthe Appropriations Committee choke off funding for a lawsuit aimed at the\nperpetrators of\nhundreds of thousands of negligent homicides while filling their campaign\nwar chests.\"\n\nLEO\nLight 'em up!\n\nLeo walks off in one direction. Josh pounds the door frame, then walks off\nin the opposite direction.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nCharlie is standing behind his desk staring silently at the phone receiver\nin his hand.\nLeo walks in.\n\nLEO\nCharlie?\n\nCHARLIE\n[evenly, calmly] Leo, there was an accident at 18th and\nPotomac. Mrs. Landingham was\ndriving her car back here.\n\nLEO\nWhat happened?\n\nCHARLIE\nThere was a drunk driver and they ran the light at 18th and Potomac. They\nran it at a high speed.\n\nLEO\nCharlie, is she all right?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo...She's dead.\n\nLeo stares at Charlie for several moments, completely stunned. Leo wavers\nback and forth\njust a bit, trying to absorb Charlie's words. He looks lost, overwhelmed,\ntotally shaken,\nbut he finally musters his ability to speak.\n\nLEO\n[a bit hoarse] Is he alone?\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nLeo turns, walks past Mrs. Landingham's desk, and walks out onto the\nveranda. Charlie watches\nLeo leave, then quickly hangs up the phone.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE VERANDA - CONTINUOUS\nA few Secret Service agents and Marine guards are standing at attention at\nseveral designated\npoints on the veranda. Pools of light illuminate the darkness as Leo slowly\nand reluctantly\nmakes his way toward THE OVAL OFFICE. He appears dazed and he moves with\nthe stiffness of a\nmuch older man. His clothes seem to hang on him. As he reaches the French\ndoors, the light from\nthe office reveals the apprehension and dread on his face. Bartlet is standing,\nwith his back\nturned, reading a document and talking on the phone. Leo does not move for\na several seconds;\nhe appears even older and more frail through the wavy glass in the French\ndoors. When he finally\nreaches for the door knob, Bartlet notices him and gestures for him to come\nin, which he does.\nLeo closes the door. Bartlet hangs up the phone, removes his glasses, and\nturns toward Leo.\nThrough the wavy glass, Bartlet's features are distorted somewhat as he\nlistens to Leo speak.\nBartlet cocks his head slightly to one side as Leo breaks the sad news.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

LANDINGHAM\n[slightly amused] Why do you work here?\n\nJED\nI'm sorry?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWhy do you work here after classes? I can't imagine that anyone in your\nfamily's on\nwork-study.\n\nJED\nNo, I-I get free tuition, so, you know, I guess it's a good idea to give\nsomething back.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWhy do you call your father \"sir\"?\n\nJED\n[chuckles softly] Is this gonna be a whole afternoon of questions?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWell, actually, you've been talking for quite some time.\n\nJED\nI'm sorry. Am I boring you, Dolores?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[demurely] \"Mrs. Landingham,\" please!\n\nThey stop walking and face each other.\n\nJED\nMy father's the Headmaster.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[mystified] Yeah, but before he was your Headmaster, he was your father,\nright?\n\nJED\nI don't wanna make the other guys feel uncomfortable.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nSo you call him \"sir\"?\n\nJED\nYeah.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[still mystified] Oh.\n\nShe walks away and Jed watches her go.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, DC STREET - PRESENT DAY\nThe repeated peals of sirens and the rumbling of motorcycles fill the air\nas the\nPresidential motorcade winds through downtown. The Presidential limousine\nis also\naccompanied by several police cars and black SUVs.\n\nCUT TO: INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet and Abbey are seated next to each other in the back seat. Bartlet,\nlooking very\npreoccupied and melancholy, stares out the window on his side. Abbey stares\nstraight\nahead. The silence between them is deafening. After a few moments, Abbey\nturns slowly\nto look at him.\n\nABBEY\n[gently] You know, they released the girl from the hospital this morning.\n\nBartlet acknowledges her words, but does not look at her. He barely turns\nhis eyes from\nthe window.\n\nBARTLET\nThe driver?\n\nABBEY\nYeah...She fractured her wrist, some stitches over her eye, and the other\ntwo had some\nscratches and bruises. [clears throat softly] It looks like they're gonna\ncharge her with\nvehicular manslaughter.\n\nAbbey looks over at him, but he doesn't respond. He just stares out the\nwindow. She\nlooks away, somewhat discouraged, but trying to figure out another way to\nreach him.\n\nABBEY\nFrank Mitchell, Joanna... Bill Carney... they told me they were in meetings\nall morning.\n\nBARTLET\n[absently] Yeah.\n\nAbbey pauses and glances at him tentatively. When she does speak, her manner\nand the look\non her face suggest that she doesn't fully agree with the viewpoint that\nshe describes.\n\nABBEY\nThe consensus seems to be that if you step back, and put your support behind\nHoynes,\nthere's a decent chance the Democrats can keep the White House.\n\nBartlet keeps staring out the window. After a long pause, he nods slightly.\n\nBARTLET\nThe world'll rest easier.\n\nAbbey seems a bit stunned by his response. She stares at him, wide eyed,\nfor several\nmoments, and then slowly looks away, resigned and sad. She looks almost like\nshe's\nabout to cry.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're here.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - DAY\nIt is a bright, Spring day. The sky is blue and trees are blooming. The\ncathedral is\nenormous and quite beautiful. As the motorcade pulls up in front of the\nchurch, with\nsirens still blaring, the sound of an organ playing a processional fills\nthe air.\n\nThe Presidential limousine stops in front of the steps leading to the main\nentrance.\nSecret Service agents open the limousine doors for Bartlet and Abbey, who\nget out on\nopposite sides of the vehicle. Bartlet walks around the back of the limousine\nand looks\nup at the huge building with a mixture of weariness and sadness. Abbey walks\nup the steps\nby his side and gently takes his hand. He lets her take it but doesn't react.\nThey walk inside.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS\nThe high arches of the cathedral are illuminated by a huge, multi-colored\nrose window.\nAlmost all of the attendees are seated as several Secret Service agents and\nushers guide\nAbbey and Bartlet to a pew in the front. Abbey sits down and Bartlet sits\ndown beside\nher, exhaling as he sits, as if it takes considerable effort for him to do\nso.\nREVEREND MONOHAN is seated at the front of the cathedral, facing the\ncongregants. Once\nBartlet and Abbey are seated, Monohan stands up. He is accompanied to the\npulpit by a\nlayperson. Toby, C.J., and Charlie look on from their seats.\n\nMONOHAN\n\"I am the Resurrection and I am Life,\" says the Lord. \"Whoever believes in\nMe shall live,\neven though he die.\" God of Mercy, You are the hope of sinners, the joy of\nsaints.\nWe pray for our sister Delores whose body we honor with Christian burial.\n\nAs Monohan speaks, the camera pans over the faces of Bartlet and Abbey,\nthen Leo. Sam,\nJosh, and Toby are seated together. Margaret, Carol and Donna are seated\ntogether.\nCarol is crying. The rose window is illuminated by the daylight.\n\nMONOHAN\nGive her happiness with Your saints, and raise up her body with the saints\nat the Last\nDay to be in Your presence forever...As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,\nand that\nat the last, He will stand upon the Earth...\n\nThe camera lingers on a very somber Bartlet. He is staring straight ahead,\nlike a statue,\nand only half listening to the service, as he drifts back in time.\n\nMONOHAN\nAfter my awaking, He will raise me up...\n\nYOUNG MRS. LANDINGHAM [VO]\nJed?\n\nMONOHAN\n...and in my body, I shall see God...\n\nYOUNG MRS. LANDINGHAM [VO]\nJed!\n\nMONOHAN\n...and I myself shall see, and my eyes behold, Him who is my friend...\n\nFADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY\nIt's a sunny afternoon. Young Jed Bartlet is hosing down several sculls. Young\nMrs.\nLandingham walks up beside him to catch his attention.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nJed.\n\nBartlet seems distracted, or perhaps he doesn't hear her. He continues his\nwork.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nJed!\n\nJED\n[looks over, sees her, and smiles slightly] I'm trying to get through an\nhonest day's\nwork, Mrs. Landingham.\n\nMRS.

LANDINGHAM\nWhat's that?\n\nJED\nTelling me I'm doing something wrong before I've had a chance to do it at all.\n\nMRS.

WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY\nBartlet is still staring straight ahead as the service proceeds. Clearly,\nhis mind\nis elsewhere.\n\nMONOHAN\nFirst reading will be from Mr. Charles Young, from the Book of Wisdom,\nChapter III.\n\nCharlie walks slowly toward the pulpit, led by a layperson.\n\nFADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - A DIFFERENT DAY, AFTERNOON\nThe bells of the school chapel are ringing softly. Young Mrs. Landingham is\nwaiting\nfor young Bartlet at the end of the school day. She spots him, reading while\nhe walks,\nand gets his attention. They walk across the grounds as they talk.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nI'd like an opportunity to make my case.\n\nJED\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nI'm raising an issue.\n\nJED\nYou've been raising this issue for a week now.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nI can tell it's had quite an effect on you.\n\nJED\nDon't you have a husband?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWhat does that have to do with anything?\n\nJED\nI'm saying, shouldn't you maybe go home when you're done with work?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nShouldn't you be minding your own business?\n\nJED\nI just thought, since you're minding everybody else's, you know...\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\n\nJED\nIn my family, we don't talk about money.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nThat's because you have money.\n\nJED\n[walking away] Numbers, Mrs. Landingham.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nExcuse me?\n\nJED\nIf you want to convince me of something, show me numbers!\n\nJed walks away and Mrs. Landingham walks inside a school building, which is\nconstructed of gray stone.\n\nFADE TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY\nThe camera drifts across the gray stone walls of the cathedral. Charlie is\nstanding at\nthe pulpit, reading.\n\nCHARLIE\n\"But the souls of the virtuous are in the hands of God. No torment shall\never touch them.\"\n\nBartlet is staring straight ahead. He looks very sad.\n\nCHARLIE\n\"In the eyes of the unwise, they did appear to die, but they are at peace. For\nthough\nin the sight of others they were punished, their hope is full of immortality.\"\n\nThe camera looks down from high above the congregants.

LANDINGHAM\nIf we paid people by according to how many children they have to support\nthen Malcolm\nBundy, the groundskeeper, would get triple what the Head Master gets.\n\nJED\nMrs. Landingham...\n\nMRS.

Call on\nAltman, it will be a medical question, it'll have two or three\nfollow-ups. It'll allow\nyou to feel comfortable a little before you start with the political mess.\nBartlet scoffs.\n\nC.J.\nAltman will be in the front row, first seat on your right.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.

We're in show business, and we'll get back to tending our\negos in\nshort order. But tonight we offer a play. It's called \"Isaac and Ishmael.\" We\nsuggest\nyou don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out where this episode comes\nin in the\ntimeline of the series. It doesn't. It's a story-telling aberration, if\nyou'll allow.\n\nRICHARD SCHIFF\nNext week, we'll start our third season.

THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT\nDonna leads the school kids into the mess from a hallway right outside.\n\nDONNA\nRight in here. Just grab a seat anywhere. Right in here. This is the mess.\nThis is where we eat lunch. We'll just... wait here.\n\nJosh walks up from behind Donna.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's going on?\n\nDONNA\nHow should I know?\n\nJOSH\nWould you call Leo's office and find out what's going on, and, more\nimportant,\nhow long it's going to be going on for?\n\nDONNA\nThey're probably scared. You might try lightening up a little bit.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, I'll definitely give that a try.\n\nJosh and Donna follow the rest of the kids into the mess. Josh stands in\nfront\nof the kids and addresses them.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, well, uh, this is called a \"crash.\" It means there's been some kind of\nsecurity breach and no one's allowed in or out of the building.\n\nJosh turns around, smacking his hands together nervously, and looks at Donna,\nwho is standing behind him.\n\nJOSH\nWould you call Leo's office?\n\nDonna goes off to a side room, and picks up a phone.\n\nJOSH\nSo, I guess we should use this time. Uh, this is the White House, the home\nof the\nPresident and the Executive Branch, the most powerful of the three branches\nof\nthe federal government.\n\nJosh is pacing back and forth in front of the students. One of them raises\nhis hand\nto ask a question.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nBILLY\nActually, Mr. Lyman, isn't it true that the Framers made sure that the\nExecutive\nBranch was the weakest of the three branches? Because we were breaking off\nfrom the\nroyalist model that put absolute power in just one place. I mean, isn't that\nwhy they\nmade the Legislative branch-or People's Branch-the most powerful?\n\nJosh stops in front of Billy, and acts vaguely menacing, a little smirk on\nhis face,\nand Donna can be seen reentering in the background.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's your name?\n\nBILLY\n[with a slight hesitation] I'm Billy Fernandez.\n\nJOSH\nI'll call you Fred. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. I don't\nknow how long\nwe're all going to be here, but you just made my list.\n\nBilly smiles, and Josh walks off, continuing.\n\nJOSH\nYes, I suppose, technically, constitutionally the Legislative Branch is the\nmost\npowerful, but we get a motorcade, so back off. All right, you already know\nabout the\nbranches of government, I assume you know how a bill becomes a law. What do\nyou want\nto talk about?\n\nThe kids make no response, they seem nervous.\n\nJOSH\nGuys, seriously, it's nothing to worry about. We've been having these crashes\nonce a week.\nLet's go. Somebody ask me something.\n\nA girl pipes up from the group.\n\nGIRL 1\nSo... what's the deal with everybody trying to kill you?\n\nJOSH\nWell... it's not everybody, and they're trying to kill you, too.\n\nGIRL 1\nBut mostly you.\n\nJOSH\nNo, both of us the same. Let's go, it doesn't have to be about politics. You're\noff\nto college. I'm the guy who knows what you need to know. Sophomore year,\nmy roommates\nand I got a fish registered for 18 credits, and she made Dean's List. My\nroommates and\nI made a Dean's List of a different sort, but that doesn't matter.\n\nAnother boy, behind Billy, pipes up.\n\nBOY 1\nDo you get scared coming to work at the White House?\n\nJOSH\nNo. I mean, we're bystanders, basically, and we work around a lot of people\nwho\nroutinely put themselves in harm's way-the Secret Service and the military.\nYou know, the protection detail? They practice a thousand different scenarios\nfor a gun: who tackles the president, who opens the car, who's covering the\nperimeter, and there's one guy whose job it is to stand in front of the\nbullet.\nNot get the shooter-stand in front of the bullet. I've seen him do it.\n\nGIRL 1\nDo you ever think about quitting?\n\nJOSH\nNo. [hesitates for a moment, and continues] Well... my, uh... my mother\nwants me to.\nMy family members have a habit of, uh, dying before you're supposed too. So\nit's\njust me and my mom now and... You guys know I guess, that I got accidentally\nshot\na little bit or something at Rosslyn. So, she'd like to see me in the private\nsector.\nBut I tell her my government salary may not be a lot, but I still make more\nthan\nthe guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet, so how do I tell\nhim I'm\nquitting? So she made me this box that I'm supposed to keep in the trunk of\nmy car,\nand it's got a super-powered flashlight, five gallons of water, and a\ntransistor\nradio, and some first aid. But she keeps thinking of things to add to\nit. She'll\ncall and say, uh, \"I found that cap that Dad got Joe Pepitone to sign for\nyou on\nyour birthday. You wore it to school every day in the seventh grade. You\nwant me\nto send it to you so you can put it in the box?\"\n\nJosh has trailed off a bit, and stops for a moment, looking sad and serious.\nHe looks around the room for a moment. He starts up again, livelier.\n\nJOSH\nSo... I'll say \"Yeah, Ma, let's put it in the box.\"\n\nJosh gives a little chuckle. He walks over, leaning against something by\nthe wall.\n\nJOSH\nSo anyway, I... I don't know against who, and I don't know what it's going\nto look like,\nbut one of these days we're gonna have a big win, and for a lot of us who've\nseen what\nwe've seen, we're not leaving till we do. I'm gonna be here six presidents\nfrom now,\nin my office, Wile E. Coyote and a map.\n\nGIRL 2\nSo why is everybody trying to kill us?\n\nJOSH\nIt's not everybody.\n\nGIRL 2\nIt seems like everybody.\n\nBOY 2\nIt's just the Arabs.\n\nBOY 1\nSaying the Arabs is too general.\n\nBOY 2\nIt's Islamic.\n\nJOSH\nIt's not Arabs. It's not Islamics. [to Donna] They're juniors and seniors?\n\nDONNA\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nYou're juniors and seniors. [heads over to a dry erase board across the room]\nIn honor of the SAT's you're about to take, answer the following question.\n\nHe erases the board, and Donna hands him a marker.\n\nJOSH\nThanks. Islamic extremist is to Islamic as \"blank\" is to Christianity.\n\nJosh writes this on the board as he speaks it again to the kids.\n\nJOSH\nIslamic... extremist... is to... Islamic... as... \"blank\" is... to\nChristianity.\n\nBOY 2\nChristian Fundamentalists.\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nBOY 3\nJehovah's Witnesses?\n\nJOSH\nNo. Guys, the Christian right may not be your cup of tea, but they're not\nblowing\nstuff up. \"Islamic extremist is to Islamic as \"blank is to Christianity.\"\n\nNo one responds. Josh turns around and writes \"KKK\" on the dry erase board,\nand circles it.\n\nJOSH\nThat's what we're talking about. It's the Klan, gone medieval and global. It\ncouldn't\nhave less to do with Islamic men and women of faith of whom there are millions\nupon\nmillions. Muslims defend this country in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine\nCorps,\nNational guard, police and fire departments. So, let's ask the question again.\n\nGIRL 1\nWhy are Islamic Extremists trying to kill us?\n\nJOSH\nThat's a reasonable question if ever I heard one. Why are we targets of war?\n\nBOY 2\nBecause we're Americans.\n\nJOSH\nThat's it?\n\nGIRL 3\nBecause of our freedom?\n\nJOSH\nNo other reasons?\n\nBOY 3\nFreedom and democracy.\n\nJOSH\nI'll tell you, right or wrong-and I think they're wrong-it's probably a good\nidea to\nacknowledge that they do have specific complaints. I-I hear them every\nday-the people\nwe support, troops in Saudi Arabia, sanctions against Iraq, support for\nEgypt.\nIt's not just that they don't like Irving Berlin.\n\nDONNA\nYes, it is.\n\nJOSH\nNo, it's not.\n\nDONNA\nNo, not about Irving Berlin, but your ridiculous search for rational reasons\nwhy\nsomebody straps a bomb to their chest is ridiculous.\n\nJOSH\nYou just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence.\n\nDONNA\nHardly a record for me.\n\nJOSH\nAnd you just made my list.\n\nDONNA\n[to the kids] Nothing happens on the list.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a serious list. But she does have a point, albeit college girlish.\n\nDONNA\nWatch now, as he's going to put me down and make my point at the exact same\ntime.\n\nJOSH\nHardly a record for me. What's Islamic extremism? It's strict adherence to\na particular\ninterpretation of 7th century Islamic law as practiced by the prophet Mohammed,\nand\nwhen I say \"strict adherence,\" I'm not kidding around. Men are forced to pray,\nwear\ntheir beards a certain length. Among my favorites is there's only one\nacceptable cheer\nat a soccer match: Allah-uh-Akbar-God is great. If your guys are getting\ncreamed,\nthen you're on your own. Things are a lot less comic for women, who aren't\nallowed\nto attend school or have jobs. They're not allowed to be unaccompanied,\nand oftentimes\nget publicly stoned to death for crimes like not wearing a veil. I don't\nhave to tell\nyou they don't need to shout at a soccer match because they're never going\nto go to one.\nSo what bothers them about us? Well, the variety of cheers alone coming from\nthe cheap\nseats at Giants stadium when they're playing the Cowboys is enough for a\njihad, to say\nnothing of street corners lined church next to synagogue, next to mosque,\nnewspapers\nthat can print anything they want, women who can do anything they want\nincluding taking\na rocket ship to outer space, vote, and play soccer. This is a plural\nsociety. That\nmeans we accept more than one idea. It offends them. So yes, she does have\na point,\nbut that certainly doesn't mean you should listen to her.\n\nGIRL 3\nSo... what do we do now?\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nGIRL 3\nWhat do we do now?\n\nJOSH\nWell, I think for help with that question we're going to need some people\nsmarter than I am.\n\nDONNA\nDefinitely.\n\nJOSH\nThing is... that's pretty tough to find. But I'm going to go upstairs and\nsee if I can\nget some of my friends to come down and join us. Listen, I-I don't know\nwhat's going on\nand I don't know how long we're going to be here. Are you guys hungry?\n\nGIRL 1\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nFreddy, why don't you grab a couple of people, go to the back of the kitchen,\nget apples\nand peanut butter? Guys, I've gotten entire pieces of legislation through\nCongress on\napples and peanut butter. I'll be back in a little bit.\n\nJosh exits the mess.\n\nCUT TO: INT. A DARKENED OFFICE ROOM - NIGHT\nA man, clearly of Arab decent, sits by a window, smoking a cigarette.\n\n\t5:22 PM, OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING.\n\nOut in the HALLWAY, Ron Butterfield and four other Secret Service men walk\nquickly to\nthe room where the man is. The man continues to smoke, until he hears the\ndoorknob\nto the room rattling behind him, and he tosses his cigarette out the window. A\nSecret\nService agent kicks in the door, gun drawn for firing. The agents hurry into\nthe room,\nand the man looks startled.\n\nAGENT 1\nSecret Service, don't move!\n\nRON\nShow us your hands. Do it now.\n\nThe man puts his hands up. He is clearly frightened.\n\nRON\nAre you Raqim Ali?\n\nRAQIM ALI\nYes. The-there's-\n\nRON\nStay calm. I'm Special Agent Ron Butterfield of the United States Secret\nService.\nKeep your hands over your head and step away from the window.

Ron waits for Leo to close all the doors\nbefore speaking.\n\nRON\nFive hours ago, Khuram Sharif was taken into custody while crossing from\nOntario into\nVermont. There was a warrant for his arrest in connection with an attempted\nbombin at\nLaGuardia. Turning State's evidence over to the U.S. Attorney, he named\nseveral\ncoconspirators. One of whom was Yaarun Nabi. A preliminary check in the NCIC\nkicked out\nfive aliases. One of which was Raqim Ali. There are three Raqim Alis. One's\na software\ndesigner in Spokane. Another is a caterer in Los Angeles.\n\nLEO\nWho's the third?\n\nRON\nHe works in the White House.\n\nLeo is surprised, almost speechless.\n\nLEO\nIt was only a matter of time, huh?\n\nRON\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. DARK OFFICE - NIGHT\nThe Raqim Ali that works in the White House is seated at a table. Several\nagents are around,\none of whom is asking him questions.\n\nAGENT\nHave you ever heard of Khuram Sharif?\n\nALI\nYes. He was arrested in connection with an attempted bombing of one of the\nNew York airports.\nI think he may have also been arrested once in Patterson, New Jersey.\n\nAGENT\nPatterson means something to you?\n\nALI\nI was born there.\n\nAGENT\nWhere did you go to school?\n\nALI\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied\nMathematics.\n\nLeo suddenly walks in with Ron.

WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT\nToby is now in front of the group of children.\n\nTOBY\nKill them all. Yeah.\n\nBOY 1\nAll the Islamic Extremists?\n\nTOBY\nNo, no. I mean everyone. You're all bothering me. I want to be left\nalone. Clearly, the only\nway that's gonna happen is to be alone. So I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to\nlet you all go.\n[pause] Except the Yankees and the Knicks... and the Yankees and the Knicks\nare gonna need\nsomeone to play, so keep the Red Sox and the Lakers... and the Laker girls,\nand The Palm,\nand we'll need to keep the people who work at The Palm. That's it though. The\nYankees, the\nRed Sox, the Knicks, the Lakers, the Laker girls, and anyone who works at\nThe Palm. Sports,\nLaker girls, and a well-prepared steak. That's all I need... Sometimes,\nI like to mix it up\nwith Italian... and Chinese. All right, you can all stay, but don't bug\nme. You're on\nprobation. Don't forget. I was this close to banishing you.\n\nJOSH\nThis is Toby Ziegler, and actually, he's in charge of crafting our message\nto the public.\n\nTOBY\nAnd today, that message is?\n\nBOY 1\nDon't bug me?\n\nTOBY\nThat's right.\n\nGIRL 1\nNice beard.\n\nTOBY\nMy choice, sister. And by the way, there's nothing wrong with a religion\nwhose laws say a\nman's got to wear a beard or cover his head or wear a collar. It's when\nviolation of these\nlaws become a crime against the State and not your parents that we're talking\nabout lack of\nchoice. [looks at the visual aid, reads] \"Islamic Extremists is to Islamic\nas KKK is to\nChristianity.\" That's... that's about right. That's a good religious\nanalogy. What's the\npolitical analogy? What's an analogy using governments?\n\nBOY 1\nThey don't have a government.\n\nBOY 2\nThey have the Taliban. They have the government of Afghanistan.\n\nTOBY\nThe Taliban is not the recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban\ntook over the\nrecognized government of Afghanistan. And there's your political analogy.\n\nBOY 2\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTOBY\nWhen you think of Afghanistan, think of Poland. When you think of the Taliban,\nthink of the\nNazis. When you think of the citizens of Afghanistan, think of the Jews in\nconcentration camps.\nA friend of my dad's was at one of the camps. He used to come over to the\nhouse, and he and\nmy dad used to shoot some pinochle. He said he once saw a guy at the camp\nkneeling and praying.\nHe said, \"What are you doing?\" The guy said he was thanking God. And my\ndad's friend said,\n\"What could you possibly be thanking God for?\" He said, \"I'm thanking God\nfor not making me\nlike them.\" Bad people can't be recognized on sight. There's no point in\ntrying.\n\nJOSH\nActually, we already covered that.\n\nTOBY\nIt's worth covering twice, don't you agree?\n\nJOSH\nI do.\n\nA girl raises her hand to get Toby's attention.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nGIRL 2\nPinochle's a card game?\n\nTOBY\n[pause] Yeah, I've changed my mind again.

I know in the eleventh century... I'm gonna\nhave trouble\npronouncing this, in the eleventh century, [sighs] secret followers of\nAl-hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah,\nwho were taught to believe in nothing and dare all, carried out these very\nswift and very\ntreacherous murders of fellow Muslims, and they did it in the state of\nreligious ecstasy.\n\nSam walks in behind, looking around.\n\nTOBY [cont.]\nAs a matter of fact, young men between 12 and 20 were given hashish, and uh,\nsmuggled into a...\nI really don't know what they call it, they were smuggled into a kind of\nspecially designed\npleasure garden complete with concubines. They were told this was paradise,\nand that the\nMaster's Angels would carry them back if they carried out murders of the\nMaster's enemies.\n\nSAM\nAh, temptation. I have named thee, and thy name is woman.\n\nJOSH\nThis is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director. Now, don't be frightened\nwhen I tell you\nthat in this room, Sam is the knowledgeable terrorism expert.

Al-Hassan\nIbn-al-Sabbah?\n\nSAM\nYeah, from the eleventh century.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nBy the way, the Arabic name for their secret order has survived until\ntoday. Can anybody guess\nwhat it was? Their Arabic name. [points to a boy] You know.\n\nBOY 3\nAssassins?\n\nSAM\nAssassins. That's right.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, we don't call on him.\n\nLaughter.\n\nTOBY\n[to Sam] What's going on?\n\nSAM\nThere's supposed to be a meeting at Treasury.\n\nTOBY\nI had a 6:00 on the Hill, now I'm stuck here, you know, talking with\nwell-dressed children\nwho can't vote.\n\nGIRL 1\nYou know a lot about terrorism?\n\nSAM\nI dabble.\n\nGIRL 1\nWhat are you struck by most?\n\nSAM\nIt's 100% failure rate.\n\nGIRL 1\nReally?\n\nSAM\nNot only do terrorists always fail at what they're after, they pretty much\nalways succeed in\nstrengthening whatever it is they're against.\n\nBOY 1\nWhat about the IRA?\n\nSAM\nThe Brits are still there. The Protestants are still there. Basque extremists\nhave been staging\nterrorist attacks in Spain for decades with no result. Left Wing Red Brigades\nfrom the 60s and\n70s, from the Bader-Meinhoff gang in Germany to the Weatherman in the\nU.S. have tried to take\nover capitalism. You tell me. How's capitalism doing?\n\nBOY 2\nWhat about non-violent protest?\n\nSAM\nWhat about it?\n\nBOY 2\nWell, it worked for Gandhi.\n\nSAM\nYeah, it did. Who else did it work for?\n\nBOY 1\nThe Civil Rights Movement.\n\nSAM\nThat's right.\n\nGIRL 1\nYeah, but weren't we terrorists at the Boston Tea Party?\n\nSAM\nNobody got hurt at the Boston Tea Party. The only people that got hurs was\nsome fancy boys\nwho didn't have anything to wash down their crumpets with. We jumped out\nfrom behind bushes,\nwhile the British came down the road in their bright red jackets, but never\nhas a war been\nso courteously declared.

Spy satellites are great if you're trying to\ndetect\nwhether or not Kruschev's put missiles in Cuba. But if you want to overhear a\nconversation over Turkish coffee in Khyber Pass, you need a spy.

Yeah, we can root terrorist nests but\nsome of these\nguys aren't going to be taken by the 105thn armored tank division. Some of\nthese guys\nare going to be taken by a busboy with a silencer. So it's time to give the\nintelligence\nagencies the money and the manpower they need. We don't hear about their\nsuccesses.\nGuess what? The Soviets never crossed the Elbe.

Mostly they come from exactly where you'd expect: places of\nabject poverty\nand despair. Horribly impoverished places are an incubator for the worst\nkind of crime.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhich is the same as it is right here.\n\nEveryone turns to look at Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nSame as it is here.

Men are men, and men'll seek pride. Everybody\nhere's got\na badge to wear. \"I'm the Deputy Communications Director.\" \"I made Presidential\nClassroom.\"\n\"I know the answer. I'm going to Cornell.\" You think bangers are walking\naround with their\nheads down, saying, \"Oh man, I didn't make anything out of my life. I'm in\na gang.\"\nNo, man!

Killing yourself and innocent people\nto make\na point is sick, twisted, brutal, dumb-ass murder. And let me leave you with\nthis\nthought before I go searching for the apples that were rightfully mine:\nwe don't need\nmartyrs right now. We need heroes.

I went there with some friends after graduation.\n\nAGENT\nCould you tell me about the Islamic League of Allston?\n\nALI\nIt used to be my mosque.\n\nThe agent who entered the room speaks quietly with Ron and then leaves. Ron\nand the\nagent who has been questioning ALI confer with the agent who delivered the\nmessage.\n\nAGENT MESSENGER\nWe found him.\n\nRON\nWhere?\n\nAGENT MESSENGER\nGermany.\n\nRON\n[to the other agent, who is nodding] I'm fine.\n\nRon quickly leaves with the agent who delivered the message.\n\nAGENT\nMr. Ali, you're free to go. Thank you.\n\nALI\nThank you.\n\nAli sighs heavily as everyone leaves, except Leo, who sits motionless in\nhis chair\nand stares at Ali. Ali gets up to leave and is almost out the door when he\nstops,\nturns and walks back toward Leo.\n\nALI\nYou know what, Mr. McGarry? You have the memory of a gypsy moth. When you\nand the\nPresident and the President's daughter and about a hundred other people --\nincluding me,\nby the way -- were met with a hail of .44-calibre gunfire in Rosslyn, not\nonly were the\nshooters white... they were doing it because one of us wasn't.\n\nLeo stares blankly ahead and only looks up as Ali leaves. Leo's expression\nchanges\nslightly, a hint of sadness on his face.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MESS - NIGHT\nAbbey is sitting at the front of the room. Josh is sitting in a chair by\nthe door,\nhis arms crossed.\n\nSTUDENT\nHow did all this start?\n\nABBEY\nHow did what all start?\n\nSTUDENT\nWell... this...\n\nABBEY\nSarah... God said to Abraham, \"Look toward the heaven and number the stars\nand so\nshall your descendants be.\" But Abraham's wife, Sarah, wasn't getting any\nyounger,\nand God wasn't coming through on His promise... I was very young when I had\nmy kids.\nI was very, very, very, very young. I was barely even born yet when I had\nmy oldest\ndaughter, Elizabeth.\n\nJosh and the students laugh quietly. Abbey glances over at Josh, who is\nsmiling at her.\n\nABBEY\nAnyway, Sarah was getting older, and she was getting nervous because she\ndidn't have\nany children. So she sent Abraham to the bed of her maid, Hagar, and Abraham\nand Hagar\nhad Ishmael. And not long after they did, God kept His promise to Sarah,\nas He'd always\nintended to, and Abraham and Sarah had Isaac. And Sarah said to Abraham,\n\"Cast out this\nslave woman with her son, for the son of the slave woman will not be heir\nwith my son\nIsaac.\" And so it began: the Jews, the sons of Isaac. The Arabs, the sons\nof Ishmael.\nBut what most people find important to remember is that, in the end, the\ntwo sons came\ntogether to bury their father.\n\nJOSH\nI think most people also find it important to remember that the whole thing\ntook place\nabout 73 million years ago.\n\nABBEY\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\n[walks in] Excuse me, ma'am. We're clear.\n\nABBEY\nWell, that's that then. It was good talking with you guys. Hang in there.\n\nAbbey stands up and leaves, along with several agents. Josh sits down in a\nchair near\nthe front of the room.\n\nJOSH\nWell, all right. That's it then.\n\nSTUDENT\nCan I ask one more question?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nSTUDENT\nDo you favor the death penalty?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nSTUDENT\nBut you think we should kill these people?\n\nJOSH\nYou don't have the choices in a war that you do in a jury room. But I - I -\nI wish...\nwish we didn't have to. I think death is too simple.\n\nSTUDENT\nWhat would do instead?\n\nJOSH\nI'd put 'em in a small cell, and make them watch home movies of the birthdays\nand baptisms\nand weddings of every single person they killed, over and over, every day,\nfor the rest\nof their lives. [clears his throat] And then they'd get punched in the mouth\nevery night\nat bedtime. By a different person, every night. There'd be a long list of\nvolunteers,\nbut that's all right. We'll wait...But listen, don't worry about all this\nright now.\nWe got your covered. Worry about school. Worry about what you're gonna tell\nyour parents\nwhen you break curfew. You're gonna meet guys, you're gonna meet\ngirls... [looks at Billy]\nNot so much you, Fred.\n\nThe students chuckle weakly.\n\nJOSH\nLearn things. Be good to each other. Read the newspapers, go the movies,\ngo to a party.\nRead a book. In the meantime, remember pluralism. You want to get these\npeople? I mean,\nyou really want to reach in and kill them where they live? Keep accepting\nmore than one\nidea. Makes 'em absolutely crazy.\n\nThe students are all listening very intently.\n\nJOSH\n[good-naturedly] Go.\n\nJosh stands up and shakes hands with the students and Marjorie as they file\nout.\n\nJOSH\nSee you later. Okay.\n\nMARJORIE\nThank you.\n\nJOSH\nThank you. Thanks a lot. It was fun. Don't steal anything on the way\nout. Okay.\n\nSTUDENT\nBye-bye.\n\nBilly is one of the last to leave.\n\nJOSH\nBilly. [gestures for him to wait] Listen...\n\nJosh waits for the others to leave. Billy looks up at Josh expectantly.\n\nJOSH\nNothing, just...just keep doing what you're doing.\n\nBILLY\n[almost whispering] Okay.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. [They shake hands.] See you.\n\nBILLY\nBye.\n\nBilly leaves, carrying his jacket. Josh turns, his hands in his pockets,\nand watches Billy leave.\n\nCUT TO: INT. ALI'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo walks slowly inside. Ali is working at his desk.\n\nLEO\n[solemnly] Good evening.\n\nAli looks up.\n\nLEO\n[stiffly] That's the price you pay... for having the same physical features\nas criminals.\nThat's what I was gonna say.\n\nALI\n[quietly] No kidding.\n\nLEO\nI'm sorry about that. Also about the crack I made about teaching Muslim\nwomen how to drive.\n\nAli looks down, taking this in. Leo, nervously, stiffly, his eyes wandering\na bit, searches\nfor the correct words.\n\nLEO\nI think if you talk to people who know me, they'd tell you that... that was\nunlike me,\nyou know? We're obviously all under, um... a greater than usual amount\nof... you know.\nAnd like you pointed out, with the shooting and everything...\n\nA long silence falls between them. Ali looks up and searches Leo's face.\n\nLEO\nYeah. [nods slightly] All right. Well, that's all.\n\nLeo turns slowly and walks out into the hall. Ali turns back to his desk\nand continues\nworking. Leo hesitates, then turns around.\n\nLEO\nHey, kid...\n\nAli turns to look at Leo. The opening notes of \"For What It's Worth\" by\nBuffalo Springfield\nbegin.\n\nLEO\n[softly] Way to be back at your desk.\n\nThey stare at each other for a few moments. Leo turns and leaves. Ali turns\nslowly back to\nhis desk.\n\n\tThere's something happening here\n\tWhat it is ain't exactly clear\n\tThere's a man with a gun over there\n\tTelling me I got to beware\n\tI think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound\n\tEverybody look what's going down.\n\n\tThere's battle lines being drawn\n\tNobody's right if everybody's wrong\n\tYoung people speaking their minds\n\tGetting so much resistance from behind\n\tI think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound\n\tEverybody look what's going down.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

The FDA's gonna approve RU-486.\n\nLEO\nHow do you know?\n\nJOSH\nC.J. had a source.\n\nLEO\nYou're not supposed to have that information.\n\nJOSH\nThe source was non-governmental. Leo, they're doing it on Monday.\n\nLEO\nYou've confirmed it?\n\nJOSH\nAs well as I can. I've been at it most of the night. I'd like to go through\nback\nchannels, see if I can hold 'em off.\n\nLEO\n[shaking his head] No.\n\nJOSH\nThen I think we have to consider postponing the speech.\n\nThey pause next to the bar, facing each other.\n\nLEO\nI'm going out to see the President first thing in the morning. Let me talk\nto him.\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nLEO\nAll right.\n\nLeo leaves. Josh stares after him.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER\nA number of staffers, including Joey, Kenny, Larry, Ed, Josh and Sam, are\nsitting,\npacing, and standing around the conference table. They're all reading a\nreport on\npolling data that Joey has prepared.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThese are hot off the presses.\n\nJOSH\nEarly numbers?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nYeah, these are just preliminary after the first sixteen hours.\n\nSAM\n[reading] \"How much faith and confidence do you have in President\nBartlet? Great Deal:\n21%, Somewhat: 24%, Only a Little:15%.\"\n\nLARRY\n[reading] \"Not at All: 38%.\"\n\nSAM\nWe got 45% in the top two boxes. That's better than we thought.\n\nJOSH\n[reading] \"Do you feel he's physically able to perform his duties as\nPresident?\"\n\nED\n\"Probably Not\" and \"Definitely Not\" at 39%.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThat number'll go down as we educate the public about MS.\n\nLARRY\n[nodding] Yeah, with 25% saying they don't know.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's the bottom line?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nFor an incumbent to have any chance at all at this point in the calendar,\nhe needs 40%.\n\nSAM\nAnd if the election were held today?\n\nJOEY\nForty-one.\n\nLARRY\n[reading] \"Forty-one percent would re-elect him, 37 would elect a new person.\"\n\nED\n[reading] \"Twenty-two percent don't know.\"\n\nSAM\nHe's in the ball game.\n\nJOSH\nAll right, I'm gonna set up some meetings for tomorrow. We'll have the final\nnumbers for\nthis set and we'll figure out where to go from here. Thanks everybody.\n\nJosh gets up quickly to leave.\n\nSAM\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nThey walk out to the HALLWAY.\n\nSAM\nListen, I was talking to Toby earlier.\n\nGinger walks past them in the opposite direction.\n\nJOSH\nHey, Ginger.\n\nGINGER\nHey.\n\nSAM\n[to Ginger] Hey.\n\nSAM\nAnd I was saying that actually he hasn't apologized.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do you mean?\n\nSAM\nI looked over the transcript and he hasn't apologized.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, well, I don't know what to say.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nLet me ask you something.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nThe release I wrote about the tobacco appropriations...\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWhat would you think about my leaking it to the subcommittee?\n\nThey pause in the middle of the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nI wouldn't do it.\n\nJosh scowls a little and considers Sam'S comment for a few seconds.\n\nJOSH\nI'm doing it.\n\nJosh turns and keeps walking. Sam walks after him.\n\nSAM\nOkay...So you don't think we're gonna get hung with the apology?\n\nJOSH\nHang on.\n\nJosh spots one of the monitors on the wall. C.J. is briefing the press. She's\nnot wearing\nher suit jacket, so presumably this is a later press conference than the\none before.\nJosh stops and turns up the volume on another television in one of the\ncubicles.\n\nREPORTER [on T.V.]\nCan you talk about the level of military force you're going to show Bazan?\n\nC.J. [on T.V.]\nIt'll be what's called an Alpha-strike formation fly-over.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nC.J. is standing at the podium. She looks very tired. Toby is watching from\nthe office\narea at the back of the room.\n\nC.J.\nIt's five F-18 fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nSteve.\n\nSTEVE\nThe injured Marines - has the President spoken to their families or them yet?\n\nC.J.\nThe President's expressed his gratitude and his concern to the Marines and\ntheir families.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nFEMALE REPORTER\nDid they express any concern for the President or the President's health?\n\nC.J.\nNo, the President's health isn't a matter of concern.\n\nThe reporters holler a bunch of questions at C.J., none of which she\nacknowledges.\nShe strikes the podium lightly with her palm and continues to respond to\nthe previous\nquestion, while looking increasingly tense and flustered.\n\nC.J.\nThe conversation was focused on the Marines and their contribution to our\nnational\nsecurity.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nMark.\n\nMARK\nThere are reports of Coast Guard cutters intercepting Haitians off the\nFlorida Keys?\n\nC.J.\n[checking her notes] Yeah, they're being considered economic refugees and\ndiverted to\nGuantanamo Bay.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\n[loudly, trying to be heard over the din] Carl.\n\nCARL\nDoes this mean that the President can't afford to spend his own political\ncapital right\nnow by accepting mass numbers of refugees?\n\nC.J.\nThat's not a factor.\n\nToby is looking more and more nervous from his vantage point at the back of\nthe room.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nJoan.\n\nCarl asks a follow up question, despite C.J.'s attempt to call on someone\nelse. C.J.\nlistens impatiently and a bit wearily to Carl.\n\nCARL\nDo you think that the President's political problems make it more or less\nlikely that he\nwill order an invasion?\n\nC.J.\nAgain, that's not a factor.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nJoan?\n\nCARL\nI'm sorry, Joan. C.J., would you say that the President's situation makes\nit harder for\nhim to focus on the situation in Haiti?\n\nIncreasingly impatient, C.J. takes off her glasses and tosses them on the\npodium.\n\nC.J.\nTo be honest with you, Carl, I think the President's relieved to be focusing\non something\nthat matters.\n\nThe room is instantly quiet, except for the sound of cameras clicking and\nflashing. The\nreporters stare at her, astonished. Toby looks stunned, his eyebrows raised\nand his mouth\nhanging open. It take a moment for C.J. to realize the scope of her\nblunder. Not looking\nup, tucking her hair behind her ear.\n\nC.J.\nObviously, what I meant to say was...\n\nCARL\nExcuse me, did you just say he was relieved?\n\nC.J.\n[still not looking up] Obviously what I...\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.! C.J.!\n\nAs every reporter in the room is clamoring, C.J. never looks up. Toby turns\nand leaves\nthe room, rubbing his head. He runs into Sam in the HALLWAY. Toby is shaking\nhis head,\nstill shocked.\n\nSAM\n[looking sick to his stomach] Toby...\n\nTOBY\n[gesturing, gasping] I don't believe it.\n\nSAM\nYou saw it?\n\nTOBY\nI was standing right there.\n\nSAM\n\"He's relieved\"...he might have to send troops into battle?\n\nToby turns Sam back in the direction of the briefing room exit door. They\nslowly walk\ntoward it as they talk.\n\nSAM\n\"He's relieved\"...he might have to put American lives at risk and kill\nHaitian civilians\n'cause it takes his mind off having lied to the electorate?\n\nAs they reach the briefing room exit door, the door opens and C.J. walks\nout into the\nhallway amid the sound of reporters calling out her name. Only half looking\nup, she takes\none step in the direction of her office, sees Toby and Sam, and immediately\nturns to walk\nin the opposite direction so she's not facing them. She looks deflated,\nnot quite steady\non her feet, and extremely upset. They can see how upset she is, so they\nhang back.\n\nTOBY\n[gently] C.J...\n\nC.J. stops in a doorway.\n\nC.J.\n[shouting] Just... just don't say anything for a... just don't say anything\nfor a....\n\nC.J. puts her hand to her head and sighs heavily, muttering something\ninaudible to\nherself. Sam looks over at Toby, then back at C.J. None of them make a sound\nfor several\nmoments. Then C.J. pounds her hand into the wall.\n\nC.J.\n[shouting] Dammit!\n\nC.J. turns around and walks between Toby and Sam, who say nothing in response\nto her\noutburst. They still look stunned as they watch her walk off toward her\noffice.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo is seated behind his desk. Joey and Kenny are standing up in front of\nhis desk.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nTobacco.\n\nLEO\nWhat about it?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nJosh wants to send the release.\n\nLEO\nThe press release?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nYes. It's incendiary. Josh is feeling burned and he's letting his emotions,\nand dare I\nsay ego, drive what I think is a very delicate situation...\n\nMargaret comes in and hands a message to Leo.\n\nLEO\n[raises a hand to stop her] Hang on.\n\nLeo reads the message quickly, then takes off his glasses turns his head,\ngrimacing.\n\nLEO\nHoly hell.\n\nLeo gets up, leaving his glasses on his desk. As he leaves, Kenny signs\nsomething for Joey.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\nJosh is heading quickly towards C.J.'s office, but she storms in there just\nahead of him,\nslamming the door with significant force; the sound echoes through the\nhallway. Josh\nstops abruptly as the door slams. Scowling, he quickly changes direction\nand sees Toby\nand Sam. They pedeconference in the direction of Leo's office.\n\nJOSH\n\"Relieved\"? The President's relieved to be focusing on Haiti?\n\nTOBY\nI was there.\n\nJOSH\nIsn't this exactly what we said we had to be careful of?\n\nLeo comes barreling down the HALLWAY toward them. They all stop and stand\nin a circle in\nthe middle of the hall. A security officer is standing, still and silent,\nright behind\nLeo. Toby bites his nails. Josh rubs his head in frustration. Sam still\nlooks stunned,\nas does Leo.\n\nLEO\nWhat happened?\n\nJOSH\nShe was asked if the President's situation makes it harder for him to focus\non Haiti.\n\nSAM\n[defensively] There was a ramp-up.\n\nJOSH\nThere was a ramp-up but she was asked...\n\nLEO\nWhat did she say?\n\nJOSH\nShe said the President's relieved to be focusing on something that matters.\n\nLEO\n\"Relieved\"?\n\nLeo turns, fuming and shaking his head, and walks back toward his office. The\nother\nthree follow close behind, debating their options amongst themselves.\n\nTOBY\nWe can argue that...uh...she just misspoke.\n\nJOSH\nShe meant to say that the President realizes he's focusing on something that\nmatters.\n\nTOBY\nOr the President's reiterating that his focus is on something...\n\nSAM\nI don't like \"something that matters,\" like finding out the President lied\ndoesn't matter.\n\nThey all walk into LEO'S OFFICE and keep on talking as Leo methodically and\nangrily slams\nthe door between his office and the Oval Office.\n\nTOBY\nShe misspoke is all we need. We go back, we say that she misspoke.\n\nLeo slams the main door to his office, startling Josh. Leo turns to look at\nthe other\nthree men, who are standing in the middle of the room facing each other. Leo's\nrage is\nbarely contained.\n\nLEO\n[yelling] What if he has to invade? If he invades Haiti after what...[pointing]\nIt's\ngonna look like he ordered a military operation to cover up...\n\nTOBY\nShe goes back. She says she was tired.\n\nLeo walks over behind his desk. The others stay put. Josh looks especially\nuncomfortable.\n\nLEO\nC.J. doesn't misspeak!\n\nJOSH\n[quietly, firmly] She just did.\n\nLEO\n[continues to yell] If she misspoke, why didn't she clean it up in the\nBriefing Room?\nI mean, come to think of it, why didn't she clean it up in the Briefing Room?\n\nSAM\nShe actually is tired, Leo. We all are.\n\nLEO\n[really angry, sarcastic] Well, why don't we go with that, Sam? Let's go\nout and say\nwe're all tired. The President's tired. Complications due to MS.\n\nToby and Josh meet each other's gaze, both looking very uncomfortable. Sam\ntries to\nmaintain a non-aggressive tone with Leo.\n\nSAM\nWe haven't had much time...\n\nLEO\n[sharply] You had a week. How much time do you need?\n\nSAM\n[finally raising his voice, angry] Some of us have had more time than others!\n\nLeo stops cold and stares at Sam. No one speaks for several moments. Toby\ngazes at the\nceiling. Josh stares at the wall. Finally, Leo walks across the room and\nopens the main\ndoor to his office.\n\nLEO\nMargaret?\n\nMARGARET\n[appears] Yes, sir?\n\nLEO\nIs he alone?\n\nMARGARET\nYeah.\n\nLeo turns toward Josh, Toby, and Sam. Only Josh looks him in the eye.\n\nLEO\nCome up with something.\n\nLeo leaves and goes into the Oval Office.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. DRIVEWAY OF THE BARTLET FAMILY FARM - PRESENT DAY\nA black Lincoln drives up a long gravel driveway which is flanked by a wooden\nfence and\nsome trees. Several black SUVs and a few cars are parked along the side of\nthe drive.\nA large white house is barely visible in the distance. The car stops at a\nguardhouse.\nLeo is sitting in the backseat, with the window rolled down.\n\nGUARD\nGood morning, Mr. McGarry. You can go on up. He's out by the pasture.\n\nLeo nods and the car creeps forward up the driveway.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. PASTURE ON BARTLET FAMILY FARM - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet is leaning on the back of an old red pickup, wearing jeans and a\npolo shirt,\ndrinking coffee and smoking. He catches sight of Leo's car. Several barns\nand out\nbuildings, as well as farm equipment are visible off to the side. A cow moos\nin the\nbackground. Leo's driver pulls the car up close to where Bartlet is\nstanding. Leo gets\nout of the car and walks over toward Bartlet as someone walks two horses up\ntoward the\nhouse. Leo is wearing khakis and a casual suit jacket.\n\nLEO\n[shaking his head] You live in the middle of nowhere, you know that?\n\nBARTLET\nAwasiwi Odanack. It's a Abenaki phrase that means...\n\nLEO\n[a bit impatiently, like he's heard this before] ...\"beyond the village.\"\n\nBARTLET\n[at the same time] ...\"beyond the village.\"\n\nLEO\nYeah. [leans one hand against the side of the truck] Good morning,\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYou want coffee?\n\nLEO\n[shakes his head] No.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's happening?\n\nLEO\nC.J.'s got it from a non-governmental source - the FDA's gonna announce\ntheir approval\nof RU-486.\n\nBartlet pauses and nods slightly.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen?\n\nLEO\nMonday.\n\nBartlet takes another drag on his cigarette, stubs it out, and stands up.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, all right.\n\nBartlet walks slowly over into the pasture area, his hands in his pockets. Leo\nwaits for\njust a moment and then follows him.\n\nLEO\nWhy don't we consider postponing the speech?\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nYou've got laryngitis.\n\nBARTLET\n[turns around briefly, still walking] Yeah, no, I mean, why?\n\nLEO\nIt'll get wrapped up in the news...\n\nBARTLET\nIt'll get wrapped up in one news cycle. I don't give a...\n\nLEO\nIt will. Plus it gives meat to the right. Lets the press write a process\nstory. Right out\nof the gate the Bartlet campaign is pandering and bumbling and performing\nabortions in\nthe Rose Garden.\n\nLeo finally catches up to Bartlet so that they're walking beside each other.\n\nBARTLET\nScrew it, and screw anybody who writes that story.\n\nLeo looks down at the ground for a moment, then continues in a slightly\nsofter tone.\n\nLEO\nPlus, I have a hunch the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week.\n\nBARTLET\n[smiles slightly] You have a hunch?\n\nLEO\nLook...\n\nBARTLET\nOf course the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week. If we\nannounce in two\nweeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down! [testily]\nScrew it!\nIt's game time. Let's go!\n\nLeo stares at him for a few moments, silent, but continues walking. Bartlet\nwalks ahead\nto a fence that borders a huge expanse of land.\n\nLEO\nThis is a nice piece of land. It'd be better without the... floodlights and\nthe metal\ndetectors, but...\n\nBartlet leans against the fence and stares out at the cows grazing near a\nlarge pond.\nFinally, Leo walks up to the fence and leans against it, a few feet away\nfrom Bartlet,\nand looks out at the land.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLeo turns, still leaning on the fence, to look at Bartlet.\n\nLEO\nAbbey and the girls are getting in this morning?\n\nBARTLET\n[not looking at Leo] Yeah. [finally turns, still leaning on the fence,\nto face Leo]\nHow's everybody doing?\n\nLEO\n[nods] Fine.\n\nBARTLET\n[nods slightly, but looks skeptical] What about C.J.?\n\nLeo gives Bartlet a knowing look, but doesn't say anything in response. Bartlet\nglances\nat Leo and gets the message.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. [long pause, deep sigh] Laryngitis?\n\nLEO\n[shakes his head slightly] I don't know.\n\nBARTLET\nWe could just say I have MS.\n\nLeo bows his head a bit and nods a little, acknowledging Bartlet's comment,\nand gazes off\ninto the distance.\n\nLEO\nYeah...\n\nBARTLET\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm running for reelection, and I'm gonna win.\n\nLeo just looks at him. After a few moments, they both turn back to gaze off\ninto the\ndistance, still leaning on the fence, saying nothing, side by side.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

He's reading a document and talking to the\naide, while\nother people, including Donna, scurry around the room and the hallway.\n\nLEO\nWhitley left in the first van. He's there already.

One phone\ncall!\nThe President's not even involved! \"Could you do us a favor, could you hold\noff two\nweeks? We love your drug but we don't want it folded into our news cycle! He's\ngetting\nmore and more animated and distressed as he speaks. He's breathing heavily. I\ncould have\npicked up the phone, I could have picked up the phone, I could...\n\nDONNA\nJosh...\n\nAll of a sudden he turns away from her and smacks the bathroom door frame\nvery hard.\n\nJOSH\n(yelling) God!\n\nHe leans against the doorframe, looking very upset.\n\nDONNA\nWhat's this about?\n\nJOSH\n(sighs and pauses) I blew the tobacco thing... That could have helped us,\nand I was...\n\nHe looks disgusted with himself. He's still breathing heavily.\n\nJOSH\nThis is gonna be a very close election.\n\nDonna looks worried, but doesn't say anything.\n\nJOSH\nI gotta take a shower.\n\nHe turns away and shuffles toward the shower and closes the door, leaving\nDonna standing\nsilently in the middle of his room.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. BARTLET FAMILY FARM - DAY\nC.J. drives up to the guard station near the house. A police car drives past\nher in the\nopposite direction. There's a black SUV pulled up on the front lawn and a\ncouple of\nsecurity officers milling about.\n\nC.J.\nGood morning.\n\nGUARD\nYou can go on up.\n\nC.J. drives past the house and out to the barn.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BARN AT BARTLET FARM - DAY\nBartlet is standing at his lectern and scribbling notes on his\nspeech. C.J. pulls up\nnext to the entrance, gets out of her car, and walks into the barn. She\nstands near\nthe door, keeping some distance. Even though he must have heard the car door\nclose,\nhe doesn't look up.\n\nC.J.\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nCome in.\n\nC.J.\nI was told you wanted to see me.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Don't be a marriage counselor. It pisses me off. Okay?\n\nC.J. looks a little confused. He keeps scribbling notes on the speech,\nbarely meeting\nher gaze.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry?\n\nBARTLET\nYou know what I'm talking about.\n\nC.J.\nSir... She walks toward him, stopping just a few feet away.\n\nBARTLET\nThat part of my life doesn't belong to you.\n\nC.J.\n(sincerely) Sir, I was simply putting together what I thought was the best\npress event.\nThe First Lady is an excellent speaker and...\n\nBartlet dismissively waves at her, still focused on the speech.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. That's all. I'll see you out there.\n\nC.J. looks a bit dismayed and frustrated. She turns and slowly walks away,\nbut then stops\nand turns back around to face him. He's completely focused on the speech\nagain.\n\nC.J.\nSir, I think if you get a bump in the polls after today's speech, as we\nexpect you will,\nI think it'd be a good time for me to resign.\n\nBARTLET\n(looks up) Yeah?\n\nC.J.\n(nods) Well, to leave earlier would have been strategically...\n\nHe gives her another dismissive wave and tries to go back to focusing on\nthe speech.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, okay.\n\nC.J.\n(raising her voice) Look, the press is...\n\nBARTLET\n(sternly, raising his voice) That's nonsense to me and I don't care!\n\nC.J.\nWell, you might not care...\n\nBARTLET\n(yelling, gesturing) For all the new jobs we've created, there are single\nmothers\nworking two of them at minimum wage. There are school districts where less\nthan half\nthe students graduate. And a kid born in Harlem is more likely to go to\nprison than a\nfour-year college! They're bringing guns to school, C.J.!\n\nC.J.\n(hurt, defiant) Don't you dare lecture me, Mr. President! Don't you dare do\nit!\n\nBartlet stops cold, his glasses held in mid air. He looks pretty taken aback,\npractically speechless. C.J. slowly turns away from him, but seems to\nhesitate,\nnot sure if she should leave or say something else. Bartlet stares at her\nfor several\nlong moments.\n\nBARTLET\n(gently) I was never supposed to win.\n\nC.J. turns around to look at him. He's holding his glasses and rubbing them\nnervously.\n\nBARTLET\nI got in it polling in the single digits. Hoynes had it locked up. I got in\nit to give\nsome speeches and keep him honest...\n\nHe walks toward her slowly, occasionally allowing a tiny smile to cross his\nface,\ntrying to lighten the mood.\n\nBARTLET\n...then you guys came along and all of a sudden I got 22% in Iowa and then\nSouth Carolina\nand Michigan and... then Illinois.\n\nC.J. looks at him with a mixture of sadness and distress.\n\nBARTLET\n(shakes his head) It was a mistake benching you for that last press\nconference.\n\nShe just stares at him. Charlie knocks on one of the barn doors and they\nboth turn\ntoward the door.\n\nCHARLIE\nExcuse me. C.J., they need you.\n\nC.J. turns back to look at Bartlet, with a pained expression on her face,\nthe anger gone.\nHe stares at her for several moments. His expression is serious and direct,\nbut kind.\n\nBARTLET\n(softly) I need you, too.\n\nC.J. takes this in, the impact of his words really hitting her, and nods\nslightly.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nShe walks out with Charlie. Bartlet watches them go, then goes back to his\nlectern.\nHe puts his glasses on and sighs as he begins to work on the speech again.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD IN MANCHESTER - DAY\nThe Presidential motorcade, consisting of half a dozen vehicles and an\nambulance,\nraces along past farms, trees, and stone fences. Several police motorcycles,\ntheir\nsirens blaring, escort the motorcade.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BARTLET'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet and Abbey are sitting in the back seat, silent, looking out the\nwindows.\nBartlet sighs deeply.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married\nto the same\npeople they were married to before they went there?\n\nABBEY\n(looks at him, puzzled) What?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.\n\nABBEY\n(slightly amused, but concealing it) You could not have been an astronaut.\n\nBARTLET\nI'd have been a great astronaut.\n\nABBEY\nYou're afraid of heights, speed, fire, and small places.\n\nBARTLET\nI'd have overcome it to go to the moon.\n\nABBEY\n(pauses to look at him)I know you would have.\n\nBARTLET\n(pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really\nhappy about\nthat.Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.\n\nABBEY\nThere's something important I have to say.\n\nBARTLET\nSay it.\n\nABBEY\nI haven't really made up my mind yet... but at the moment... I'm leaning\ntowards\nvoting for you.\n\nThey look at each other for several moments, hints of smiles on their\nfaces. Then he\nlooks back out the window.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\nThe band is playing and the crowd is cheering as Secret Service agents make\nlast minute\npreparations onstage for the President's arrival. In a classroom off the\nhallway, the\ncampaign staff, Doug, Bruno and Connie, are meeting with the regular staff\nincluding\nDonna, Charlie, Sam, Josh and Toby. Leo and Josh are pacing, while most of\nthe others\nare leaning or sitting on the desks. Bruno is standing in the back of the\nroom.\nThey're arguing about the speech. As they argue, the cheering and applause\ncontinue\noutside. The introductory speeches have started.\n\nDOUG\n(reading) ...\"to fall victim to torpor and timidity.\" \"Torpor\"... is not a\nword a lot\nof people know.\n\nSAM\nIt means apathy.\n\nTOBY\nAnd dullness.\n\nDOUG\nI know what it means.\n\nCONNIE\nDoug means...\n\nDOUG\nThey know what I mean.\n\nC.J. walks into the room and closes the door behind her. She looks a little\ntired.\n\nC.J.\nHey.\n\nLeo and Toby look up to acknowledge her, but they don't say anything. They\njust turn\nback toward Doug.\n\nDOUG\nIf they don't know what the word means...\n\nC.J.\nWhat's the word?\n\nJOSH\n(after taking a sip of water) \"Torpor.\"\n\nC.J.\nIt means apathy.\n\nTOBY\nAnd dullness.\n\nEveryone but Doug is looking more and more impatient with this conversation,\nrolling\ntheir eyes, standing up. Even Bruno looks annoyed.\n\nDOUG\n(louder, more exasperated) I know what the word means. I'm saying if people\ndon't know\nwhat the word means...\n\nBartlet walks in briskly through a door behind Doug.\n\nBARTLET\nThey can look it up!\n\nEveryone, including Doug, stands. Bartlet stops and stands next to the\nteacher's desk\nat the front of the room.\n\nEVERYONE\nGood morning, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug. It's our\njob to raise\nit. If you're going to be the \"Education President,\" it'd be nice not to\nhide that you\nhave an education.\n\nAbbey's voice can barely be heard as she starts her speech. Bartlet points\nat Bruno and\ngestures politely to Doug to leave.\n\nBARTLET\nBruno, would you mind?\n\nBruno nods. He, Doug and Connie quietly leave the room. As the door opens,\nthe staff\ncan hear a bit of Abbey speaking and the crowd applauding and cheering.\n\nABBEY (VO)\n...of being elected Governor of his home state.\n\nBruno and his colleagues close the door, returning the room to relative\nsilence.\nBartlet sighs and casually leans against the desk. There's a portrait of\nAbraham\nLincoln on the wall. Leo and Charlie are standing somberly behind him.\n\nBARTLET\nChurchill and FDR: serious men using big words for big purpose.\n\nBartlet stops and pauses for several moments, like he's changing his mind\nabout what to\nsay. The staff look at him patiently and expectantly, like they're anticipating\nan\ninspiring lecture. He sighs, then speaks with great emotion.\n\nBARTLET\nIt occurs to me, I never said \"I'm sorry.\" (pause) I am. (pause) For the\nlawyers, for the\npress, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys are\ngood. They want\nto win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder if\nyou can't do\nboth. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words.\n\nBartlet slowly stands up.\n\nBARTLET\nThere's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart,\ndisciplined\ncampaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble,\nnothing\nthat's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothing\nthat shows\nyou think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby?\n\nTOBY\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIt isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of a\ngreat nation.\nWe're gonna write a new book, right here, right now. This very moment. Today.\n\nThe staff look more determined, especially C.J. An aide opens the door\nleading out to\nthe hallway and the podium. C.J. turns at the sound of the door opening. Once\nagain,\nthey can hear Abbey speaking.\n\nABBEY (VO)\nAnd so, my friends...\n\nAIDE\nSir?\n\nBartlet nods at the aide, then looks back at Leo and Charlie. They do not\nwaver as they\nmeet his gaze.\n\nABBEY (VO)\n...it is my pleasure and my great fortune to introduce my husband, our\nfriend,\nNew Hampshire's greatest son, and the President of the United States: Josiah\nBartlet.\n\nThe crowd's cheers and applause get louder and louder as Abbey finishes her\nspeech.\nBartlet walks toward the door, past the staff, and buttons his jacket. Only\nCharlie\nfollows him. The rest of the staff wait for Bartlet to leave. Just as he\nreaches the\ndoorway, he stops and hesitates. He hears Abbey say his name. And then he\nturns around\nto face them.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know what? Break's over.\n\nBartlet turns and walks out through the hallway to the podium where Abbey\nis standing,\nwaiting for him, clapping along with the crowd. The cheers and applause have\ngotten\nvery loud. When Bartlet reaches the podium, he kisses Abbey and then he\nturns to wave\nto the crowd. C.J., Josh, Sam, Toby and Leo emerge onto the podium, one by\none, and\nassemble themselves behind Bartlet. They clap along with the crowd. Donna\nand Charlie\nhang back by the doorway, clapping.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

Josh...\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nDONNA\nI'm not going to have to take a 19th century English literature midterm, am I?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nDONNA\n'Cause in one of these boxes are memos and handwritten notes pertaining to the\nPresident's 100,000 new teachers initiative, since it's a major policy\ninitiative\nlaunched right after a suspected MS attack.\n\nJOSH\nCan I ask you something?\n\nDONNA\nI had a plan.\n\nJOSH\nWhen you say in one of these boxes...\n\nDONNA\nI had a plan! Each box was numbered. There is a piece of paper with a number\nand a\ncorresponding description of the contents of each box.\n\nJOSH\nWell, where is the piece of paper? [Donna glares at him.] It's... in one of\nthese boxes.\n\nDONNA\nI had a plan. [moves yet another box, angrily] I grew up on a farm.\n\nJOSH\nYou grew up in a condo.\n\nDONNA\nI grew up near a farm. I was cute. And I was peppy. And I always did well\non my 19th\ncentury English literature midterms till you came along and sucked me into\nyour life of\ncrime!\n\nJOSH\nHey, I'm not the one...\n\nDONNA\nWhite collar crime boy. [gets another box] You know what they do to a girl\nlike me on\nthat cellblock? I've seen those movies!\n\nJOSH\nYeah, me too.\n\nDONNA\nI'll bet you have!\n\nJOSH\nLook...\n\nDONNA\nSell my farm-girl ass for a carton of Luckys.\n\nJOSH\nHey, seriously, you need to sleep for a while.\n\nDONNA\nI can't yet. 'Cause in one of these boxes are FedEx receipts and mailroom\nrecords for\nany gifts or packages sent to senior staff, [starts yelling] and in one of\nthese boxes\nis a piece of paper which says which box it's in!\n\nJOSH\n[scared off] I'll be in the office.\n\nDONNA\nYour office is down the corridor about 200 feet from here. Try not to commit\nany felonies\non the way.\n\nJOSH\nI'll do my best. [leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nSam catches up with Josh.\n\nSAM\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nDonna's like two, three days from unspooling. It's pretty fun to watch,\nbut can you loan\nme some senior assistants from Communications?\n\nSAM\nYeah. So listen, there's a fire in Yellowstone Park.\n\nJOSH\nWell, put it out.\n\nSAM\nTechnically, I'm not a professional firefighter, though there was a time I\nwanted to be.\n\nJOSH\nWhen?\n\nSAM\nWhen I was four.\n\nJOSH\nWhen I was four, I wanted to be a ballerina.\n\nSAM\nYeah?\n\nJOSH\nI don't like to... talk about it.\n\nSAM\nThere was a dry lightning strike in a lodgepole pine forest. Fire spread to\n500 acres but\nit's all inside the resource benefit zone.\n\nJOSH\nIs it all under control?\n\nSAM\nWell, as a matter of fact, last night the park's superintendent - in\nconsultation with\nBill Horton and several deputies from the Department of the Interior decided\nto let it\nrun its course.\n\nJOSH\nThey're letting it burn?\n\nSAM\nIt's not necessarily our policy to put these things out.\n\nThey walk in JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.\n\nJOSH\nPutting out fires isn't necessarily our policy?\n\nSAM\nFire's good for the environment under certain circumstances. Forests have\na natural cycle\nthat requires purging burns to reinvigorate growth.\n\nJOSH\n[pours himself coffee] Someone just said that to you, right?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do we need to do?\n\nSAM\nThe President needs to talk on the phone with the governor.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nSo that the President can say he talked on the phone with the governor.\n\nJOSH\nI'll take care of it.\n\nSAM\nBallerina?\n\nJOSH\nI'd kind of like that not to get around.

Oliver and Ainsley are inside with C.J.\n\nOLIVER\nYou can emphasize that it's not like being served.\n\nC.J.\nHow is it not like being served?\n\nOLIVER\nA subpoena is just a legal agreement to produce certain testimony and\ndocuments.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but isn't it like the way a mugger uses a gun to produce your wallet?\n\nOLIVER\nYou say we'll cooperate fully. You say subpoenas don't indicate otherwise. You\nsay\nthey're a commonly used legal tool to define the scope of the inquiry!\n\nC.J.\nOliver, political reporters don't care about the scope of the inquiry;\nthey hear\n'subpoenas'...\n\nOLIVER\nLook...\n\nC.J.\nMy trouble with your spin is that we're not going to get anywhere putting\non a calm face.\nWe need to pick a fight!\n\nAINSLEY\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nBecause in politics, if you're not on offense, you're on defense.\n\nOLIVER\nYour problem there is that Clem Rollins doesn't foam at the mouth. He's a\ngood guy and he\ncomes off as a good guy.\n\nAINSLEY\nPlus he was appointed by your own Attorney General which is going to make\nit tough to fit\nhim with a black hat.\n\nC.J.\nLet me think for just a second. [walks to the door] What do Republicans say\nabout him?\n\nAINSLEY\nWell, we don't all hang out at a little club...\n\nC.J.\nWhat do they say about him?\n\nAINSLEY\nHe's well-respected, he's deliberate, he takes his duty seriously, he wants\nto get the\ntruth and he wants to avoid any appearance of impropriety or partisanship.\n\nC.J.\nExcuse me! [storms out of the office]\n\nOLIVER\nWhere are you going?\n\nC.J.\nWe need a different enemy. [leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I'm sweet as pecan pie.\n\nLEO\n[puts on his coat] Yeah?\n\nJOSH\nI hate these people, Leo. And when this thing is done, I'm going to personally\nscrew them\nwith their pants on!\n\nC.J.\n[comes in] Excuse me.\n\nLEO\nHey, C.J..\n\nC.J.\nLeo.

You know why?\n\nLEO\nRollins likes us.\n\nC.J.\nI don't know if he likes us but he doesn't hate us.\n\nLEO\nWell, that's just because he doesn't know us.\n\nLeo walks on, but C.J. grabs his arm and swings him into an empty office.\n\nC.J.\nLeo, we need to be investigated by someone who wants to kill us just to\nwatch us die.\nWe need someone perceived by the American people to be irresponsible,\nuntrustworthy,\npartisan, ambitious and thirsty for the limelight. Am I crazy or is this\nnot a job for\nthe U.S. House of Representatives?\n\nLEO\nWell, they'll get around to it sooner or later.\n\nC.J.\nSo let's make it sooner. Let's make it now. Rollins is driving them slow,\nhe won't talk\nto the press, they're ready to jump ... I swear to god, Leo, I think we can\nmove the show!\n\nLEO\n[beat] You got a briefing now?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nShow me what you're starting with.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nThey walk off in different directions.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Bobbi?\n\nBOBBI\nWhy are the subpoenas necessary?\n\nC.J.\nThey're a commonly used legal tool to define the scope of the inquiry. Steve?\n\nSTEVE\nWhat about the Congressional hearings?\n\nC.J.\nWell, obviously we don't think they're necessary, but that's not for us\nto say...\n\nSTEVE\nDo you...\n\nC.J.\n... and we take a different view than Congressional Republicans do of\nthis Special\nProsecutor's performance thus far: we believe he's running a thorough and\nimpartial\ninvestigation and he should be allowed to finish his work.\n\nSTEVE\nI'm sorry, C.J., you say 'a different view.' Is Congress unhappy with\nthe Special\nProsecutor?\n\nC.J.\nYou'd have to ask Congress that.

I need a solid pen that feels\ngood in my\nhand, but it's not so formal I feel like a dandy.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm making some trips to the pen store, aren't I, Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nI used to have the perfect pens. Every day right here, in my pocket. I loved\nthose pens!\nBalance, great action, paper soaked up the ink what the hell happened to\nthose pens? Do\nthey not make them anymore?

She fixes her hair in the glass door, while CLIFF CALLEY\nwalks out.\n\nCLIFF\n[hails the cab] Taxi!\n\nThe cab leaves. Cliff turns around.\n\nCLIFF\nArghh.

I mean, I can look good.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't have any trouble believing that. But listen, it sounds like maybe\nyou're having\nsome problems with boxes, and I know how that can be, so if you'd rather\ndo this...\n\nDONNA\nWill you buy me a drink?\n\nCLIFF\nSure!\n\nThey head back into the restaurant.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBOBBI\nC.J., can you clear up whether the Special Prosecutor can compel the\nPresident's staff to\ndisclose conversations he's had regarding his MS?\n\nC.J.\nWell, Executive Privilege protects all communications that are necessary to\nenable a\nPresident to do his job, but as I said the President's waiving Executive\nPrivilege. Mark?\n\nMARK\nCan you tell us if...\n\nBOBBI\nExcuse me, Mark. I need to follow up on that. How can Bartlet be claiming\nto waive\nExecutive Privileges yet still reserve the right to withhold certain\ndocuments? Isn't he\njust trying to protect himself?\n\nC.J.\nActually, he's trying to protect the office of the presidency. Information\npertaining to\nnational security, for instance.\n\nBOBBI\nStop being coy, C.J..\n\nC.J.\nI was born this way.\n\nBOBBI\nYou don't think Clement Rollins will be angry, and with every reason to be,\nif the White\nHouse leaves out certain documents?\n\nC.J.\nI think if you want to know what Clement Rollins thinks, you should read\nsome of his\nwritings on the subject. He was a University of Chicago Law School professor\nand I'm not\nsure, you can check me on this but I think he was editor of the Yale Law\nReview.\n\nThe reporters write her words down. C.J. looks satisfied.\n\nC.J.\nThat's a full lid, everybody, have a good night.\n\nShe heads off the podium and closes the door to the HALLWAY, and a piece of\npaper she\nthrows across the hall lands directly in the waste basket.\n\nCAROL\nC.J.? Governor of Wyoming has been on TV. [comes up]\n\nC.J.\nIs he mad at us?\n\nCAROL\nHe's pretty irate.\n\nC.J.\nGood irate, or...\n\nCAROL\nHe's irate.\n\nC.J.\nAll right. Circulate a memo to anyone who's going to see a microphone.\n\nThey walk down the hall, Carol is taking notes.\n\nC.J.\nThe National Fire Plan is based on Recommendations from five Federal\nagencies. It clearly\nstates that 80 years of fire suppression hasn't worked; for centuries,\nwildfires have\nbeen a natural part of the evolution of the forest ecosystems.\n\nCAROL\nWhen something catches on fire, it's no longer out policy to put it out?\n\nC.J.\nThat's the kind of thing they shouldn't say. Put that in the memo with a\ncircle and a\nline through it.\n\nC.J. walks into her OFFICE, where Oliver is standing.\n\nOLIVER\nC.J....\n\nC.J.\nOliver.\n\nOLIVER\nThank god for Lexis-Nexis, huh?\n\nC.J.\nI'll say.\n\nOLIVER\nHow long did it take to find the paper I wrote with Rollins?\n\nC.J.\nAbout an hour.

California...\n\nTOBY\nA state I begged you to let secede from the Union.\n\nJOSH\nThe... entire California delegation wants a compromise. If they don't get one,\nthey vote\nto repeal.\n\nTOBY\nWe lose about another 13 votes from rural districts. Maybe 3 of them will\nswitch back to\nus if it was close but they'd get killed next November and I wouldn't ask\nthem to do it.\n\nLEO\nThat's 283. Where are the other 7 votes against us?\n\nJOSH\nThat's the thing.\n\nTOBY\nIt's from inside the Black Caucus. That's where the 7 votes are.\n\nLEO\nI want you two to see Mark Richardson first thing in the morning.\n\nJOSH\nWe already set it up.\n\nLEO\nWhen you're done, we'll make a recommendation to the President, he'll make\nhis decision\nto fight or live to fight and that'll be that.

OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nBartlet comes in.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm expecting a call from Bill Horton and I left the National Fire Plan in\nthe dining\nroom.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'll run over and get it.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks.\n\nCharlie leaves, Bartlet reads from inside the folder. As soon as the door\ncloses, Bartlet\nturns to Mrs. Landingham's empty desk, looks at it, slides his hand over\nit. Leo comes by.\n\nLEO\nGood evening.\n\nBARTLET\nThe governor of Wyoming was an inch an a half away from calling me a\npyromaniac tonight.\n\nLEO\nThat's surprising 'cause we really had respect from him before.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm saying somewhere out there is a registered voter who's thinking, 'You\nknow, I thought\nI really liked this Bartlet fellow, but now that I see he's in favor of\nfire...'\n\nLEO\nHe thinks it's gonna adversely affect tourism.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's the end of the season and the fire isn't anywhere near tourists. Letting\nthis fire\nburn is good for the environment. You know how I know?\n\nLEO\nHow?\n\nBARTLET\nBecause smart people told me. Please god, Leo, let them be right.\n\nLEO\nWhen are you talking to Horton?\n\nBARTLET\nAny minute.\n\nLEO\nYou want me to handle the call?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nI'll be in my office.\n\nLeo leaves. Bartlet looks at the empty desk again, and sits behind it. He\nopens the\ndrawer and finds a box with pens in it. He takes one of the pens, holds it\na while, then\nputs it in his pocket, closes the box and returns it to the drawer.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: EXT.

I hate them, Donna. They're all so...poor. And\nmany of them\ntalk funny, and don't have proper table manners. My father slaved away at\nthe Fortune\n500 company he inherited so I could go to Choate, Brown, and Harvard, and\nsee that this\ncountry isn't overrun by poor people and lesbians.\n\nDonna smiles.\n\nCLIFF\nNo, I-I'm a Republican because I believe in smaller government. This country\nwas founded\non the principle of freedom, and freedom stands opposed to constraints,\nand the bigger\nthe government, the more the constraints.\n\nDONNA\nWow.\n\nCLIFF\n[a little surprised] You agree with that?\n\nDONNA\nNo, it's crap, but you're really cute.\n\nCLIFF\nYeah, I know. [chuckles softly]\n\nDONNA\nI had a hunch you did.\n\nCLIFF\nOh.\n\nDONNA\nListen, you know who my boss is, right?\n\nCLIFF\nI do.\n\nDONNA\nAnd that he's one of the point men in this fight with Ways and Mean over\nthe estate tax?\n\nCLIFF\nThe death tax.\n\nDONNA\nHe doesn't like to call it that.\n\nCLIFF\nWe've been ordered to. There was a memo.\n\nDONNA\n[smiles] Right... Anyway and not to editorialize but since we're fighting\nfor the\nbetterment of ordinary people while you're voraciously protecting the\ngrotesque wealth\nof the few, I wasn't sure if this was awkward for you.\n\nCLIFF\nListen, Robin Hood...\n\nDONNA\nYou don't think it's a good tax?\n\nCLIFF\nIt was, in 1916, when this country's wealth was concentrated and we wanted\nto prevent\nthe emergence of an aristocratic class, however...\n\nDONNA\nSays Choate, Brown, and Harvard.\n\nCLIFF\nThe wealth is now spread among farmers, small business owners, farmers,\nmerchants, and\ndid I mention farmers?\n\nDONNA\nSo a second date wouldn't be awkward for you?\n\nCLIFF\n[chuckles] Uh... This is my last week working for Ways and Means.\n\nDONNA\nReally?\n\nCLIFF\nI've been traded.\n\nDONNA\nTo where?\n\nCLIFF\nHouse Government Oversight.\n\nDONNA\nWhat'd they trade you for?\n\nCLIFF\nSome toner, I think.\n\nDONNA\n[smiling] No, I mean why?\n\nCLIFF\nI don't know. We got a call from the Majority Leader's office. They wanted\nanother\nlitigator at Government Oversight and they didn't... they didn't say why...\n\nHe looks concerned, as he suddenly realizes why he was traded.\n\nDONNA\nMaybe it was just an oversight.\n\nCliff doesn't react. He just stares at the ground.\n\nDONNA\nOh, come on! \"Maybe it was just an oversight\"? I don't even get a courtesy\nlaugh?\n\nCLIFF\n[with regret in his voice, shaking his head] The boxes.\n\nDONNA\n[still smiling] What about 'em?\n\nCLIFF\nI have to say goodnight now.\n\nHe shakes his head a little and walks away. Her face falls and she looks\nbewildered.\nThe Capitol is lit up in the background.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY\nSam and Connie are sitting next to each other on a sofa. VICTOR CAMPOS is\nseated across\nfrom them. A staffer brings in glasses of water, then leaves.\n\nVICTOR CAMPOS\nYou didn't bring me out from L.A. to talk about the Hispanic Educational\nLongevity Program.\n\nSAM\nVictor, I was wondering why you passed on the Commission?\n\nCAMPOS\n[chuckles bitterly] You didn't bring me out here to talk about H.E.L.P and\nyou didn't\nbring me out here to talk about the Commission.\n\nSAM\nAnd you didn't go to Indiana to watch a basketball game.\n\nCAMPOS\n[leans forward, takes a glass of water] It was a good game.\n\nSAM\nDon't get cute with me.\n\nCAMPOS\nWatch your mouth.\n\nSAM\nNo, I don't think I will, Victor. We fought a war together. What the hell\nhappened to\nloyalty?\n\nCAMPOS\n[sets the water glass down on the table] You tell me.\n\nSAM\nYou know what? The President promised to ban permanent striker replacement\nworkers, and\nhe did it.\n\nCAMPOS\nThank you. So the jobs he isn't shipping overseas will be safe and secure.\n\nSAM\nWho else was talking about prenatal care for illegal immigrants in Davenport,\nIowa?\n\nCAMPOS\nThat isn't where it needs to be talked about.\n\nSAM\nHe put an empowerment zone in Pacoima and no one has worked harder to raise\nthe minimum\nwage.\n\nCAMPOS\n*Mi gente ganan m.s que el m'nimo sueldo!\n[My people earn more than the minimum wage!]\n\nSAM\n*Te subiU al podio en la maldita convenciUn, Victor!\n[You were up on the podium at the damn convention, Victor!]\n\nCAMPOS\n*Porque necesitaban una cara morena!\n[Because they needed a brown face!]\n\nSAM\n*Estas equivocado!\n[You're wrong!]\n\nCAMPOS\nNo lo estoy.\n[No, I'm not.]\n\nSAM\nThe lowest Latino unemployment in history, more small business loans for\nHispanic\nentrepreneurs, and the biggest drop in Latino poverty in two decades!\n\nCAMPOS\nThat's what I got in the last election. What do I get in this one?\n\nSam stares at Campos for a few moments.\n\nSAM\n[leans back, quieter] What happened to loyalty?\n\nCAMPOS\nYou can't deposit it in a savings account. [beat] What do I get?\n\nSAM\nWhat do you want?\n\nCAMPOS\nThe high school dropout rate among Hispanics is higher than it is for\nAfrican-Americans.\n\nSAM\nWe're gonna double the funding for the National High School Initiative. What\nelse?\n\nCAMPOS\nChildren who came to the United States after welfare reform -\n\nSAM\nThere's gonna be a major push on the Hispanic Children's Health Act.\n\nCAMPOS\n[warily] What's a \"major push\"?\n\nSAM\nHe's gonna mention it in the State of the Union. What else?\n\nCAMPOS\nComplete amnesty...\n\nSAM\n[shaking his head] No way.\n\nCAMPOS\nComplete amnesty...\n\nSAM\nVictor...\n\nCAMPOS\n[pointing his finger, raising his voice] Complete amnesty for all undocumented\nimmigrants\nfrom the Americas. Mexico, Chile, El Salvador...\n\nSAM\nLook...\n\nCAMPOS\nThe Legal Amnesty Fairness Act is in the Senate right now!\n\nSAM\nWe can't back a bill that treats Hispanic immigrants any differently than...\n\nCAMPOS\nSam...\n\nSAM\nThere's no way we can do it.\n\nCONNIE\nSure we can.\n\nSAM\n[without looking at her] I'm sorry?\n\nCONNIE\nWe can do it.\n\nSAM\nWe really can't.\n\nCONNIE\nWe really can.\n\nSAM\n[to Campos] Would you excuse us just a second?\n\nConnie and Sam stand up and walk out into the HALLWAY.\n\nCONNIE\n[whispering] Hi.\n\nSAM\nWhen I said, \"Stay out of my way,\" did you think I meant...\n\nCONNIE\nIt's a bold stroke that'll cost you some independents, but I...\n\nSAM\nJust so he can expand his union membership?\n\nCONNIE\nIt'll also expand the Democratic Party. Millions of illegal immigrants could\ncome out of\nhiding. That's millions of potential voters who are going to vote for\nyou. Three million\nvoters in California that's 13% of the vote. 19% in Arizona. You know as\nwell as I do the\nRepublican Party is gonna try to outflank us on this. You know it's the\nright thing to\ntake to the President, so why are you giving him a hard time?\n\nSAM\nHe's giving me a hard time.\n\nCONNIE\nHe's doing what he's supposed to do. Recognize you're weaker than you were\nthree years\nago, have a little humility, suck it up, and give him what he wants, which\nis gonna help\nyou in the long run anyway!\n\nSam considers her comment for a brief moment. Then he turns back toward the\nroom, where\nCampos is pacing.\n\nSAM\nVictor.\n\nCampos slowly walks over to where Sam is standing in the doorway.\n\nSAM\nWhat do we get?\n\nCAMPOS\nExcuse me?\n\nSAM\nIf I take this to the President, what do we get?\n\nCAMPOS\nCalifornia and its 435 delegates.\n\nSAM\nI shouldn't have blown up at you before.\n\nCAMPOS\nNobody'll know.\n\nSAM\nYeah?\n\nCampos nods and walks away with a half a smile.\n\nCAMPOS\nLoyalty.\n\nCUT TO INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\nJosh and Congressman Mark Richardson are seated at one end of the table. Toby\nis pacing\nbehind Josh.\n\nRICHARDSON\nJosh, you think the Black Caucus votes as a block, and that they only care\nabout the\ncities.\n\nJOSH\nSurely, Congressman, the African-American community can think of better ways\nto spend\ntwenty-eight billion dollars than a tax break that'll benefit fewer than\na thousand\nAfrican-American families.\n\nRICHARDSON\nYou're doing it again.\n\nJOSH\nMark...\n\nRICHARDSON\nThe African-American community doesn't think one way about anything. We're\ntalking about\na few members of the Caucus.\n\nJOSH\nThat was pretty surprising.\n\nRICHARDSON\nA few members who feel that African-American homeownership is at it's highest\nlevel ever.\nThat more African-Americans are opening small businesses than ever before. And\nif they\ncan't pass it on, how will they build up power and clout and self-sufficiency\nas a\ncommunity?\n\nJOSH\nYou think a few black millionaires justifies a multi-billion-dollar boondoggle?\n\nRICHARDSON\nWell, as long as there's a Congress, there are going to be multi-billion-dollar\nboondoggles. We'd just like to share in them a little bit, please.\n\nTOBY\nWe're bleeding here, Mark.\n\nRICHARDSON\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nWe're bleeding here, for God's sake. You can work with us or you can be\nignored by a\nRepublican President, but those are your choices.\n\nRICHARDSON\nHow bad is it?\n\nTOBY\nBuckland's coming after us. He's been meeting with Victor Campos. [sits]\n\nRICHARDSON\nAnd while you guys are defending yourselves against special prosecutors\nand Jack\nBuckland, what happens to the people who got you here?\n\nTOBY\nWho are you talking to, Mark? We're not gonna forget about failing schools\nin central\ncities. [raises his voice and pounds the table with his fist] We're not\ngonna forget\nabout after-school care, health care for uninsured kids. We're not gonna\nforget about\ndrug treatment, or urban redevelopment, or community policing!\n\nRICHARDSON\nYeah?\n\nTOBY\nYou gotta not forget that we're bleeding!\n\nRICHARDSON\nThe Black Caucus doesn't vote as one mind. I can't promise anything.\n\nJOSH\nThe veto's an awfully big risk to take... if you can't promise anything.\n\nRICHARDSON\nThen the veto's an awfully big risk to take.\n\nToby and Josh look at each other, silently. Toby stands up.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nLeo and Bartlet walk by with HORTON. Bartlet is leading the way.

I-I-I liked the word...\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll go with that for now.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President, we're here to recommend that you threaten to veto any repeal\nof the\nestate tax.\n\nBARTLET\n[takes off his glasses, looks up] Really?\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nLEO\nWhat happened with Richardson?\n\nJOSH\nNo guarantees.

They both look very serious.\n\nTOBY\nLet's make the threat.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Doug, pointing] You like this?\n\nDOUG\n[emphatically] Yes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI thought you don't oppose a tax cut in an election year?\n\nDOUG\nWell, let's be clear. We're not talking about opposing a tax cut. We're\ntalking about\nvetoing one. Your first veto ever. That's... shooting the moon.\n\nToby rubs his head as Doug speaks.\n\nBARTLET\n[nods] I'll say.\n\nDOUG\nI like the bold gesture. I think you gotta get out the stamp.\n\nJOSH\n[with a slight smirk at Doug] You sign it. You don't do it with a stamp.\n\nDOUG\nI thought it was a stamp.\n\nBARTLET\nActually, you stamp it, then sign it.\n\nTOBY\nWho gives a damn, sir? This is a tax cut that benefits only 4500 families.\n\nBARTLET\nIt doesn't matter if most voters don't benefit. They all believe that someday\nthey will.\nThat's the problem with the American dream. It makes everyone concerned for\nthe day\nthey're gonna be rich... The governors of Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, and Utah,\nalong with\nthe Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House, are calling me a \"fringe\"\nenvironmentalist, 'cause I'm listening to the Secretary of the Interior and\nthe Secretary\nof Agriculture, along with the U.S. Forest Service, the Chief Ranger, and\nthe Parks\nSuperintendent.\n\nBartlet is looking through his desk drawers. He finally finds a square wooden\nbox and\nplaces it on his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nThey say letting the fire burn is good for the environment. And I'm betting\non a weather\nreport, of all things. It's just one of those times.\n\nBartlet opens the box, takes out an inkpad and a rubber stamp, and sets them\nout on his\ndesk. Leo, Josh, Toby and Doug watch him, solemnly. Bartlet takes the pen\nout of his\njacket pocket, looks at it for a long moment, places it on top of the inkpad,\nand closes\nthe box.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

The Bullpen has been\nfilling up with\nstaffers who are focusing their attention on a press conference, which is\nbeing broadcast\nvia C-SPAN. The speaker is Congressman Randall Thomas [R-Michigan]. He's\nstanding outside\nat a podium with several people behind him.\n\nRANDALL THOMAS [on T.V.]\nThis is an election year, and in some states the voting starts in a few\nmonths.

She's standing shoulder to shoulder with Sam, Josh,\nConnie, Doug,\nCarol, Toby, Ginger, Leo, Donna, Bonnie, and many other members of the West\nWing staff\nall of them staring up at the television, looking determined.

And yours, for that matter?\n\nSAM\nIt's cheaper for cattle to graze on federal lands than to feed a young basset\nhound.\n\nKIMBALL\nAnd it's easier to sell out the western states where you're not going to\nwin anyway than to help\ncattlemen whose prices are plummeting. If you look at the range land-\n\nTOBY\nI don't want to look at the range land anymore.

He'll have one of\nour members bring a\nposter on the floor another one of our members will object and the chair\nhas to rule followed\nby a vote of the full house and that'll buy 20 minutes.\n\nDONNA\nOkay. [leaves]\n\nJOSH\n[back to Buckland] So... you're polling at slightly less than five percent\nin Iowa. After hearing\nyour issue profile that number actually goes down. 39% of caucus-goers say\nthey wouldn't even\nconsider voting for you. \"Shares our values\"? 18%. Did you know that?\n\nBUCKLAND\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nIn New Hampshire, you got three percent. \"Shares our values,\" 14%. After\nhearing your profile,\n41% think you're a republican.

Did you know any\nof that?\n\nBUCKLAND\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nThe reason why you didn't know, Jack, is that you don't even have the money\nto do out-of-state\npolling right now.\n\nBUCKLAND\nSo, you helped me out.\n\nJOSH\nI did. Now with those kinds of numbers and no kind of money how can you\nexpect to run a campaign?\n\nBUCKLAND\nWhere were the president's numbers? And what kind of money did he have when\nhe challenged...?\n\nJOSH\nHe wasn't challenging a sitting president and NOBODY challenges a sitting\npresident in a primary\nby going to his right. This isn't a serious challenge you're contemplating\nso tell me what it is,\nJack.\n\nBUCKLAND\nWell, if it isn't a serious challenge what are you doing in this room?\n\nJOSH\nYour health! We don't like your health. You're a Heisman trophy-winning\nfootball player, a U.S.\nOlympian, you still run the New York Marathon and every time we see b-roll\nof you tossing a ball\naround at the local boys' club it makes people think the president's got to\ncampaign in an oxygen\ntent.\n\nBUCKLAND\nWell, it sounds like a bit of a serious challenge.

Toby\nglances across the\ntable at Sam. They both remain fairly calm.\n\nTOBY\nCongressman, you've been uneasy about the estate tax from the beginning.\n\nROYCE\nThat's right, I have. And yet, the White House did what it always does:\nit went to the extreme\nflank of its own party. Which meant more arm-wrestling, more dealmaking,\nGod knows how many\nbillions wasted in pork-barrel promises...\n\nSAM\nWhat are you saying?\n\nROYCE\nThat the moderates get shut out! Let me tell you something. The idea of\nrepealing the estate tax\nmakes me embarrassed to be a Republican. We used to be about the sensible\ncenter, about fiscal\ndiscipline. A tax break for billionaires? [scoffs] Of course this thing\nshould be vetoed!\nIt was a Republican named Oliver Wendell Holmes who said, \"Taxes are the\nprice we pay for a\ncivilized society.\"\n\nTOBY\nAre you saying...\n\nROYCE\nDon't target me for defeat. I'm vulnerable in my district. The DNC'll run\na conservative Democrat.\nIf he's elected, he won't even be photographed with the President, much less\nvote with him. Take\na look around at all the Democrats running from you right now. [pauses]\nDo you even know who your\nfriends are anymore?\n\nSam and Toby take this is for a few moments.\n\nTOBY\nIf we do our best to see that you're not seriously challenged...\n\nROYCE\nYou have seven new votes tonight. [pauses] Oh, and, uh...throw in the milk\nthing.\n\nTOBY\n[stands up, shakes his hand] Go vote, Congressman.\n\nSam shakes the Congressman's hand. Royce leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nAs Royce walks briskly down the hall, he passes Leo, who's walking in the\nopposite direction.\nLeo gives Royce a mild questioning look.\n\nROYCE\nYou're home.\n\nRoyce keeps walking. Leo walks over to the doorway of the Roosevelt Room. Toby\nand Sam are standing\naround the table gathering up their things. They both look up. Leo gives\nthem a proud smile. Toby\ndoesn't really react, but Sam smiles back. Leo turns and spots Charlie in\nthe hallway.\n\nLEO\n[to Charlie] You. Get in here.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nCharlie walks in ahead of Leo, who closes the door behind him. They stand\nin the middle of the\noffice facing each other.\n\nLEO\n[kindly but firmly] Take the immunity.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm not allowed...\n\nLEO\nTake it.\n\nCHARLIE\nIs anyone else taking it?\n\nLEO\nNo one else is being offered it.\n\nCHARLIE\nWould they take it if they were?\n\nLEO\nCharlie, who the hell knows what's gonna happen with this prosecution? It's\na partisan prosecution.\nYou could go broke! You could be barred from law school!\n\nCharlie looks concerned.\n\nCHARLIE\nDoesn't immunity imply guilt?\n\nLEO\nNot necessarily.\n\nCHARLIE\nAnd if someone in my position took a deal to protect himself...what would\nthat person be saying to\nhis employer? That they were wrong to trust him.\n\nLEO\n[a little annoyed] Don't be a hero.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy not?\n\nLeo looks a bit surprised.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'll stay with my team. People should stop trying to get me not to do that.\n\nThere's a knock on the door. It opens and Margaret walks into the office.\n\nMARGARET\nLeo?\n\nLeo glances over at her but doesn't say anything. He's still staring,\nslightly stunned, at Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\n[with a glint in his eye] Anyway, I'm not supposed to talk about it.\n\nLEO\n[nods] Yeah. Okay.\n\nCharlie turns and leaves via the door to the Oval Office. Leo watches him\nleave.\n\nMARGARET\nNancy.\n\nLEO\nThanks.\n\nMargaret shows Nancy in, closes the door, and goes back to her desk. Nancy\nlooks pleased, but in a\nfairly subdued way.\n\nLEO\nWhat are you smiling about?\n\nNANCY\nPalestinian police arrested Mujeeb at his residence in Gaza.\n\nLeo looks very relieved.\n\nLEO\nMargaret?\n\nMargaret enters.\n\nMARGARET\nYeah?\n\nLEO\n[smiling slightly] Get me C.J. on the phone... And see if there's still any\nfood over there.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\nJosh walks in, through the door across from her desk, fiddling with his bow\ntie. Donna is standing\nbehind her desk, organizing papers.\n\nJOSH\nI got away with this thing, but you should really learn how to tie a bow\ntie. He tosses the tie\non her desk.\n\nDONNA\n[weakly] Or you could.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, but that doesn't seem that likely, right? You can go home.\n\nHe starts to walk toward his office.\n\nDONNA\nI'll stick around.\n\nShe walks over to a file cabinet and picks up a folder, then walks back\nbehind her desk. He suddenly\nturns around and walks back toward her desk.\n\nJOSH\n[a little impatiently] You wanted to talk to me about something before.\n\nDONNA\n[forcing a weak smile] Yeah...Listen...I was fixed up on a blind date a few\nnights ago.\n\nShe suddenly has his full attention. He's leaning on the doorframe next to\nher desk, his body\nlanguage barely concealing his sense of unease and anger.\n\nJOSH\nWhen?\n\nDONNA\nA few nights ago...\n\nJosh is shifting from side to side, looking more and more uncomfortable and\ntrying to control\nhimself.\n\nDONNA\n...and Ainsley fixed us up. He's a Republican lawyer working for Ways and\nMeans but he was\nbeing transferred. And it turns out now... [sighs, tries to adopt a light\ntone] ...that he's\non Government Oversight-\n\nJOSH\n[firmly] You can't see him anymore.\n\nDONNA\n[serious] I know that.\n\nJOSH\nYou can't see him anymore.\n\nDONNA\nI know that.\n\nJOSH\nIt was just that night?\n\nDONNA\nYeah. [pauses] No... [sighs] We got together the next night again. We\nshouldn't have.\n\nJosh isn't looking at her. He's lowered his eyes and he's channeling as much\nfrustration as he\ncan bear to reveal into fumbling with the top button on his shirt.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\n[looking scared] Look, when we got together the first time...\n\nJosh finally manages to open the collar of his shirt and finally looks up\nat her. Disappointment\nand betrayal and hurt are infused in his voice.\n\nJOSH\nYou just thought he was with Ways and Means who I was battling on the estate\ntax.\n\nDONNA\nI'm sorry...\n\nJOSH\nDid any reporters see you?\n\nDONNA\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nThe second night?\n\nDONNA\nNo.\n\nJosh stares at her coldly.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. You can go home.\n\nDONNA\n[disheartened] The President wants you in five minutes.He stares at her for\nseveral moments.\n\nJOSH\nThanks.\n\nHe turns and walks into his office, closing the door firmly behind him. Donna\nis still standing\nbehind her desk.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT\nC.J. is briefing from the podium. Carol is standing beside her.\n\nPHIL\nC.J.?\n\nOTHER REPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nPhil.\n\nPHIL\nDid the President urge the Chairman to hand over Abdul Mujeeb?\n\nC.J.\nAs I said, the President urged the parties to abide by the terms of the\ncease-fire and he reiterated\nthe United States's commitment to the peace process.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nKatie.\n\nKATIE\nC.J., and AP report out of Gaza says the President threatened to withhold\nmore than $100 million\ndollars to Palestinian NGOs unless the Chairman handed over Mujeeb.\n\nC.J.\nWell, I'm not gonna get into the details of the diplomatic exchange. There'll\nbe more on that\ntomorrow. I'm told at this moment the House is getting ready to vote on the\noverride of the\nPresident's veto, and I know you'll all want to cover that. Since this is\nthe President's first\nveto, I thought it might be helpful if we brushed up on the rules. Sherri,\ncan you tell us how\nmany votes it takes to override a veto?\n\nSHERRI\n[surprised] I'm sorry?\n\nC.J.\nHow many votes does it take to override, Sherri?\n\nSHERRI\nA majority.\n\nC.J.\nActually, it takes two thirds.\n\nSHERRI\nYes, a two-thirds majority.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, 290. And how many votes does it take to sustain?\n\nSherri gives C.J. a quizzical look.\n\nC.J.\nThat should be easy. You just subtract 290 from the total number of members\nin the House, and add one.\n\nSherri nods.\n\nC.J.\nHow many people sit in the House of Representatives, Sherri?\n\nThe other reporters all turn to look at Sherri, who looks fairly uncomfortable\nand remains silent.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, maybe you can get the notes from a classmate. That's all, guys. I'll\nsee you in the morning.\n\nC.J. and Carol leave the room.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nCarol scurries up behind C.J., who's walking briskly through the hall.\n\nCAROL\nThey're meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nC.J.\nThanks.\n\nSherri comes out of the Press Room and walks after C.J.\n\nSHERRI\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nHey.\n\nSHERRI\nThat was totally uncalled for.\n\nC.J. keeps walking.\n\nC.J.\nYeah?\n\nSHERRI\nMy competitors are gonna show that tape. Every local station in town...\n\nC.J. stops walking to face Sherry.\n\nC.J.\nWhat? Are you crazy? That thing's going out to 154 affiliates!\n\nSHERRI\nLook...\n\nC.J.\nI changed my clothes because I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about\nthe death of two\nteenagers while wearing a ball gown, and you knew that. Because you're stupid,\nbut you're not\nstupid, you know what I'm saying? Security's gonna take your press\ncredentials. You'll call my\noffice every day and I'll decide if you get into the room. I'm taking your\nspot on Pebble Beach -\nyou can do your stand-ups from Lafayette Park.\n\nSHERRI\nWho the hell...\n\nC.J.\nOne more word out of your mouth and every local station in town but yours\ngets an exclusive with\nthe President. Hunting season on me is over.\n\nSherri glares at her and leaves.\n\nC.J.\n[quietly] And the chemical abbreviation for table salt is NaCl.\n\nC.J. walks off, presumably to the meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nIt's nearing dawn on Saturday. Bartlet, Leo, Toby, Sam, and Josh are sitting\non the sofas and\nside chairs. They all look quite tired. Bartlet nods slightly as the others\ntalk.\n\nSAM\n[to Bartlet] You could say...you could say, \"On behalf of Abbey and myself,\nplease accept our\ndeepest condolences. Your sons' lives were not lost in vain.\"\n\nJOSH\nThey were lost in vain.\n\nSAM\nWhat I meant was that this calls national attention to the peace process.\n\nC.J. knocks softly on the door and comes in. Leo nods at her. She sits down\nnext to Sam.\n\nSAM\n\"Though tragic, this tragedy further calls national attention to\nthis...alarming, escalating conflict.\"\n\nTOBY\nIs there anything to: \"They went there in the spirit of peace\"?\n\nC.J.\nThe spirit of peace, at a soccer match? Hope of Israeli and Palestinian\nchildren playing together and...\n\nJOSH\nStudying together, discovering each other's worlds...\n\nThey all glance at Bartlet, who looks very pensive and somber.\n\nBARTLET\nThis guy at the dinner, he told me something I didn't know. On Yom Kippur,\nyou ask forgiveness for\nsins against God. But on the day before, you ask forgiveness for sins against\npeople.\n[looks over at Toby] Did you know that?\n\nTOBY\nYeah. It's called, uh...I can't remember...\n\nJOSH\nIt's... Erev.\n\nTOBY\nErev Yom Kippur.\n\nBARTLET\n[nods] You can't ask forgiveness of God until you've asked forgiveness of\npeople on the day before.\n\nCharlie knocks and opens the door.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\n[looks up at Charlie] Yeah?\n\nCharlie points toward the phone.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I'm gonna do this alone. Have a good night, everybody.\n\nALL\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThey all stand up and file out. Bartlet walks over to his desk and sits\ndown. He picks up the\nreceiver but pauses for a few moments to collect his thoughts. He lets out\na deep sigh and hits\nthe button on the phone.\n\nBARTLET\n[sadly] Mr. and Mrs. Levy, this is Jed Bartlet. I have three children. I\nreally don't know what to say.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY\nSUNDAY\nFrom T.V. screens to cameras to more T.V. screens, we follow several reporters\nas they\nhead inside to take their seats. From a nearby television, we hear sounds\nfrom a football\ngame. A briefing is about to start. And as the Press Corps takes its respective\nseating,\nC.J. enters and goes behind the podium. She speaks while getting settled.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nCHRIS\nC.J., do we know what kind of gun it was?\n\nC.J.\nWhich gun?\n\nCHRIS\nThe first gun.\n\nC.J.\nIt was a .38 pistol. Okay, here are a few confirmations and a few more\ndetails. The\nshooting took place approximately 15 minutes into the 9:00 service at United\nBaptist\nChurch in Abilene, Texas. [notices a familiar man seated in the middle row\nto her left]\nWill Sawyer, is that you?\n\nWILL SAWYER\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nYou back in the country?\n\nWILL\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nYou working for the San Francisco Chronicle now?\n\nWILL\nNo.\n\nC.J.\nThen you want to get your ass out of their chair?\n\nLaughter. WILL SAWYER stands up.\n\nWILL\nThere's assigned seating?\n\nC.J.\nYou see the little brass plaques with the names of media outlets on the\nfront of the\nseats?\n\nWILL\nI thought that meant they made a generous contribution.\n\nC.J.\nFind a seat in back.\n\nWill does, and C.J. continues.\n\nC.J.\nFifteen minutes into the service, Daryl Bechtell, B-E-C-H-T-E-L-L, walked\ninto the\nsanctuary. Reports indicate he was looking for his estranged wife. He fired\noff a\nround -- that was from the .38 -- missing his wife and hitting Harold Winter\nin the\nleft shoulder. Mr. Winter is 65 and currently undergoing surgery at Abilene\nRegional\nMedical Center.\n\nCarol quietly enters the room.\n\nC.J. [cont.]\nMr. Bechtell fired off anywhere between two and four more rounds at that\npoint -- reports\ndiffer -- as the crowd began to scatter. That's when Ron Cahrl pulled a nine\nmillimeter\nGlock from under his suit coat and fired off three rounds in the direction\nof Mr.\nBechtell. It's unclear which of those rounds struck Melissa Markey.\n\nSTEVE\nConfirmation on her age?\n\nC.J.\nShe's be nine years old tomorrow.\n\nSTEVE\nCan you speak to what either Daryl Bechtell or Ron Cahrl might be charged\nwith?\n\nC.J.\nNo. The Abilene Sherrif's Office will address that. I can tell you that\nMr. Bechtell's\ngun was registered and that Ron Cahrl had a license to carry a concealed\nweapon.\n\nARTHUR\nDoesn't Texas law prohibit carrying a weapon in a church or synagogue?\n\nC.J.\nAgain, I'll have the Sheriff's Office speak to that, but I'll tell you that\nit only\nprohibits it if the church or synagogue posts such a prohibition in plain\nsight.\n\nCarol takes this time to give C.J. a note.\n\nREPORTERS\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nHang on. [reads the note] Well... Melissa Markey died.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT. WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - DAY\nSam and Donna are standing in front of the doors.\n\nSAM\nIf you don't understand a question, say so. They'll repeat it. Or they'll\nrephrase it.\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nThere's nothing wrong with not understanding the question.\n\nDONNA\nRight.\n\nSAM\nThere's nothing wrong with saying 'I don't recall.'\n\nDONNA\nI appreciate this.\n\nSAM\nYeah. Don't you want to go to this with Josh?\n\nDONNA\nHe's pissed at me.\n\nSAM\nNo, he's not.\n\nDONNA\nHe's... Yeah, he is.\n\nSAM\nHe didn't say anything.\n\nDONNA\nHe doesn't say anything.\n\nSAM\nAll right.\n\nDONNA\nAnyway, I appreciate this.\n\nSAM\n[as he sees Charlie passing by] Charlie, hang on a second. [to Donna] You're\ngoing to be\nsitting in a room. It's going to feel like you did something wrong. But\nguess what?\n\nDONNA\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nYou didn't! So, you got a cab up front?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nCome back when it's over?\n\nDONNA\nThanks. [leaves]\n\nSam follows Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou make a pick?\n\nSAM\nOakland over Dallas!\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nIt's a lock.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nEverybody's staying away 'cause they want to keep Oakland down the road. But\nif you're\nlike me, you're not as impressed with the pre-season hype. You pick the\nRaiders at home,\nand you bank on them not being a prohibitive favorite going into the playoffs.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nYou think I should take Tennessee over Detroit?\n\nCHARLIE\nI didn't say that.\n\nSAM\nYou said it with your eyes.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nI'll take Tennessee over Detroit.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm writing it down.\n\nSAM\nWrite it down. Wait. No. Give me Oakland over Dallas.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay. They stop in front of the opposite White House entrance.\n\nSAM\nExcept make it New Orleans over Atlanta.\n\nCHARLIE\nThe first games are about to start.\n\nSAM\nNew Orleans over Atlanta!\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm writing it down.\n\nSAM\nWrite it down. [leaves]\n\nThe doors open. Bartlet and Abbey walk inside.\n\nCHARLIE\nGood afternoon.\n\nABBEY\nHi, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nHow was church?\n\nBARTLET\n[mumbles] It sucked.\n\nABBEY\nIt was fine. [to Bartlet] Stop it!\n\nBARTLET\nIt sucked!\n\nABBEY\n[sighs] You're talking about church.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, like I'm not already going to hell.\n\nCHARLIE\n[follows them a pace behind] What was the problem?\n\nABBEY\nHe feels the homily lacked penache.\n\nBARTLET\nIt did lack penache.\n\nABBEY\nIt was a perfectly lovely homily on Ephesians 5:21. \"Husbands, love your\nwives, as Christ\nloved the church and gave himself up for her.\"\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. She's skipping over the part that says, \"Wives, be subject to your\nhusbands as to\nthe Lord, for a husband is the head of a wife as Christ is the head of the\nchurch.\"\n\nABBEY\nI do skip over that part.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nABBEY\nBecause it's stupid!\n\nThey walk in THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nABBEY\n\"Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up\nfor her, that\nhe might sanctify her, having cleansed her by washing of water with the word\nthat he\nmight present the Church to himself in...\" something.\n\nBARTLET\n[behind his desk, puts on glasses] \"In splendor.\" And I have no problem with\nEphesians.\nAnd any time you want me to cleanse you with the washing of water, you know\nI'm up for it.\n\nABBEY\nThen what is your problem?\n\nBARTLET\nHackery!\n\nAbbey waves her arms at him and walks out to the PORTICO. Bartlet follows.\n\nBARTLET\nThis guy was a hack! He had a captive audience! And the way I know that is\nthat I tried\nto tunnel out of there several times. He had an audience and he didn't know\nwhat to do\nwith it.\n\nABBEY\nYou want him to sing \"Volare?\"\n\nBARTLET\nCouldn't have hurt. Words...\n\nABBEY\nOh, God, no.\n\nBARTLET\nWords, when spoken out loud for the sake of performance, are music. They\nhave rhythm,\nand pitch, and timbre, and volume. These are the properties of music, and\nmusic has the\nability to find us and move us, and lift us up in ways that literal meanings\ncan't. Do\nyou see?\n\nABBEY\nYou are an oratorical snob.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, I am. And God loves me for it.\n\nThey stop and face each other.\n\nABBEY\nYou said he was sending you to hell.\n\nBARTLET\nFor other stuff, not for this. You can't just trod out Ephesians, which he\nblew, by the\nway, it has nothing with husbands and wives, it's all of us. Saint Paul\nbegins the\npassage: \"Be subject to one another out of reverence to Christ.\" [passionately]\n\"Be\nsubject to one another.\" In this day and age of 24-hour cable crap, devoted\nto feeding\nthe voyeuristic gluttony of the American public, hooked on a bad soap opera\nthat's\npassing itself off as important, don't you think you might be able to find\nsome relevance\nin verse 21? How do end the cycle? Be subject to one another!\n\nABBEY\nSo... This is about you.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, it's not about me! Well, yes, it is about me, but tomorrow it'll be\nabout somebody\nelse. We'll watch Larry King and see who. [shouts] All hacks, off the\nstage! Right now!\nThat's a national security order.\n\nABBEY\nI'm going to the Residence. I'm taking a bath; I'm turning on Sinatra.\n\nBARTLET\nHow does Mrs. Sinatra feel about that?\n\nABBEY\nPeace be with you. [turns to leave]\n\nC.J. comes outside behind Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\n[sings] You make me egg foo yung...\n\nC.J.\nGood morning, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\n[turns to her, sings] You make me feel there are songs to be sung...\n\nABBEY\n[to C.J.] He's feisty. Please, don't ask him about church.\n\nC.J.\n[quietly] No, I won't. I'm sorry, Mr. President, Melissa Markey died.\n\nBARTLET\n[smile fades away] Yeah, okay.\n\nAbbey approaches him.\n\nBARTLET\nAh, damn. Charlie, can I see Leo?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nABBEY\nShe would have lost too much blood at the scene, Jed. She didn't have a\nchance.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nABBEY\nAll right... I'll be over in the Residence. I've got to see Babish this\nafternoon.\n[pats him on the shoulder and leaves]\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. [walks with C.J. quietly] When do you think I should go in there?\n\nC.J.\nI'd wait a couple of hours till we hear some more facts.\n\nBARTLET\nYou'll talk to the sheriff's office and...\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nI guess the DA.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but you don't want to walk too far into that.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLeo is waiting by the entrance to Oval Office.\n\nLEO\nGood morning.\n\nBARTLET\nYou heard?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J. thinks I should wait a few hours.\n\nLEO\nI would.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nThank you, Mr. President. [walks off]\n\nBARTLET\nBe subject to one another, Leo. What can I do to be of subject to you?\n\nLEO\nI'm fine.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nLEO\nI've got Margaret.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nThey walk back in THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet sits behind his desk. Leo sits\nhear him.\n\nLEO\nI think you should send Hoynes to Texas.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's not going to want to do it.\n\nLEO\nWhat do you care?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat are you doing today?\n\nLEO\nI'm meeting with Adamley.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat about?\n\nLEO\nHe wants to talk to me about the War Crimes Tribunal.\n\nBARTLET\nKeep me out of it, all right?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nYou think I should send Hoynes to Texas?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, get him over here.\n\nLEO\nNow?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\n[stands] Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

I thought you were our man in Myanmar.\n\nWILL\nI got kicked out of Myanmar.\n\nC.J.\nWell, is there a third world country you haven't been kicked out of?\n\nWILL\nHey, I've been kicked out of plenty of industrialized nations, too.\n\nC.J.\nWhy'd they kick you out?\n\nWILL\nWell, first of all, they didn't kick me out exactly. In fact, they love me\nin Myanmar.\n\nC.J.\nWhat happened?\n\nWILL\nThey put a bounty on my head. [C.J. laughs.] It's not funny. The Myanmarese\ngovernment\nis built on narcotics trafficking. Myanmar, Thailand, Laos. I was this close\nto the story.\n\nC.J.\nYeah?\n\nWILL\nI had interviews with Pau Jiasheng, Pau Yujiung, Li Zuru.

There's another 1.5 billion for urgent repairs\ntargeted to\nhigh-need districts.\n\nTERRY\nLike roof repairs?\n\nSAM\nRoof repairs, heating and cooling systems, electrical wiring. The point is\nwe think we\nneed the Congressman's vote to get it out of the full Appropriations Committee\nand on the\nfloor.\n\nTERRY\nHe'll be with it.\n\nSAM\nThat's what I thought.\n\nTERRY\nHe's just looking for the President's support on a bill that he'll be\nsponsoring.\n\nSAM\nWhat's it called?\n\nTERRY\nIt's called the \"Legal Tender Modernization Act.\"\n\nSAM\nWhich provides for?\n\nTERRY\nThe elimination of the penny.\n\nSAM\nI'm sorry?\n\nTERRY\nIt would permanently halt production of the penny.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nTERRY\nI'm glad you asked.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTERRY\nLast year, the U.S. Mint cut 14 billion pennies and shipped them off to the\nFederal\nReserve, which dumped them in our laps. They're worthless.\n\nSAM\nWell, they're actually worth one cent.\n\nTERRY\nThe dollar has the buying power today that the quarter had 30 years ago. The\npenny's\nbuying power shrunk to nothing.\n\nSAM\nWell, that's not true. You can get yourself a gumball.\n\nTERRY\nNo, you can't.

He knows they're in trouble.\n\nDONNA\nI swear it wasn't premeditated. Nothing in it was material. Nothing in it\nwas...\n\nJOSH\nYou don't get to decide that! You don't get to decide what's material and\nwhat isn't,\nDonna!\n\nDONNA\nPlease keep your voice down.\n\nJOSH\nThis is how it happens. They got nothing on the President with MS. They're\ntrolling,\nthen you go in and hand them a...\n\nDONNA\nI know.\n\nJOSH\nYou were subpoenaed! You were under oath! You answer the damn question!\n\nDONNA\nI screwed up.\n\nJOSH\nYOU THINK?!\n\nDonna, in shock, does not respond. Josh sits and touches his head.\n\nDONNA\nWhat should I do?\n\nJOSH\nDo nothing. Do absolutely nothing.\n\nDonna quietly leaves and closes the door.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. HALLWAYS OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - DAY\nToby walks down the hall. The chatter of staffers gets louder as he approaches\nthe\nWHITE HOUSE MESS. When he walks in, Toby sees 30-40 staffers sitting and\nstanding on\none side of the room. Ginger is standing in the middle of the group near\nthe back.\n\nSTAFFER\nShhhhh.\n\nThe group quiets down. They all look pretty somber, like they're anticipating\na severe\ntongue lashing. Toby sits down on the edge of a table, facing the group,\nand hesitates\nfor a few moments before speaking.\n\nTOBY\nThere's an old saying: \"Those who speak, don't know; and those who know,\ndon't speak.\"\nI don't know if that's true or not, but I know that by and large the press\ndoesn't care\nwho really knows what as long as they've got a quote. Last Friday, we had\nour Week Ahead\nmeeting in the Roosevelt Room. Some of you were there, most of you weren't,\nbut I'm\ntalking to all of you now. Bruno Gianelli and I were leading a discussion\nabout whether\nor not the President should stop in Kansas on his way back from the West\nCoast, and I\nremarked that the Vice President is polling better than the President right\nnow in the\nPlains states...\n\nSam walks into the room. He stands in the doorway, looking far more stern\nthan Toby.\n\nTOBY [cont.]\n...and that if the President is re-elected, it's gonna be on the Vice\nPresident's\ncoattails. That remark made its way to a White House reporter... We're a\ngroup.\n[chuckles cheerlessly] We're a team. From the President and Leo on through,\nwe're a\nteam...We win together, we lose together, we celebrate and we mourn\ntogether. And defeats\nare softened and victories sweetened because we did them together...And if\nyou don't like\nthis team... then, there's the door... It's great to be in the know. It's\ngreat to have\nthe scoop, to have the skinny, to be able to go to a reporter and say,\n\"I know something\nyou don't know.\" And so the press becomes your constituents and you sell\nout the team...\nSo, an item will appear in the paper tomorrow, and it'll be embarrassing to\nme and\nembarrassing to the President. I'm not gonna have a witch hunt. I'm not\ngonna huff and\npuff. I'm not gonna take anyone's head off. I'm simply gonna say this:\nyou're my guys.\nAnd I'm yours... and there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.\n\nThey all look pretty deflated and chastised. Toby stands up and walks out. Sam\nwalks with\nToby back upstairs.\n\nSAM\nThat was unexpected.\n\nTOBY\n[sighs] Yeah... You're a good deputy, Sam.\n\nSAM\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTOBY\nThat.\n\nSAM\n[chuckles] You won money on football today, didn't you?\n\nTOBY\nYeah, but I mean it anyway. What can I do for you today? How can I help you\nout?\n\nSAM\nYou can give me a reason why the White House can't support the elimination\nof the penny.\n\nTOBY\nThis is the Legal Tender... Huckleberry Bill?\n\nSAM\nModernization Bill, yeah.\n\nTOBY\nWe can't support it 'cause it'll never get to the floor.\n\nSAM\nWhy not?\n\nTOBY\nWhere's the Speaker of the House from?\n\nThey've reached the STAIRS up to the main level.\n\nSAM\nHe's from Illinois, which, by the way, is the only state where you can put\npennies in\na toll machine. Why is that, do you suppose?\n\nThey pause in the middle of the stairs.\n\nTOBY\nIt's because...\n\nSAM\nIt's 'cause Lincoln's from Illinois! And... so is the Speaker.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nWell, that's a good reason. Well, it's a dumb reason, but it's good enough,\nright?\n\nTOBY\nSure. They start walking up the stairs again.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nAnd thanks for the other thing.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\nC.J. breezes into her office, passing Will who's perched on the edge of\nCarol's desk.\n\nC.J.\nHi.\n\nWILL\nHi.\n\nShe walks behind her desk and starts shuffling papers around. He stands up\nand leans in\nthe doorway.\n\nC.J.\nWhat do you need?\n\nWILL\nYou called me.\n\nC.J.\nYes, I did... Well, Toby made the remark in response to some new polling\ndata. It was\noffhand. Obviously, he meant it as a joke. He regrets it.\n\nWILL\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nHe'll be happy to go on the record with you.\n\nWILL\n[shrugs] Nah, that's all right.\n\nC.J.\nWhat do you mean?\n\nWILL\nI don't need him.\n\nC.J. walks toward him having gathered up the papers she needs. They walk\nout into the\nHALLWAY.\n\nC.J.\nYou're not gonna let Toby explain himself?\n\nWILL\nI'm not writing it.\n\nC.J.\nWhy not?\n\nWILL\n[mildly indignant] It's not news.\n\nC.J.\nReally?\n\nWILL\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\n[surprised and pleased] Okay.\n\nWILL\nI'll see you in there.\n\nHe turns to walk away. She keeps walking, with a happy yet puzzled look on\nher face, but\nthen she turns around.\n\nC.J.\nYou weren't joking before, were you?\n\nWILL\nWhen?\n\nC.J.\nWhen you said...\n\nWILL\nNo.\n\nC.J.\n[walks toward him a little bit] Why do you think the White House is a bad\nbeat?\n\nWILL\nI don't like being a stenographer. And I don't like writing gossip.\n[walks toward her a little bit] I read a column last week where a lady\nbemoaned the\ndecade of scandals she's had to cover, as if the news was to blame for the\nquality of\njournalism. I don't know if there's ever been a more important time to be\ngood at what\nI do. Can you imagine how much I don't give a damn about what Toby said to\na staffer?\n\nC.J.\nYeah... All right.\n\nShe walks away, but just before she opens the door to the Briefing Room,\nshe turns around.\n\nC.J.\nYou can sit anywhere you want.\n\nShe goes into the Briefing Room. He walks back down the hallway, his hands\nin his pockets.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\nThe camera pans up on the globe by the desk. Adamley is sitting on the\nsofa. Leo is\nwalking over to his chair.\n\nLEO\n139 countries have signed. 35 have ratified. Once 60 ratify, that's the ball\ngame. You\nwant to be left out? [sits]\n\nADAMLEY\nAbsolutely. And I'll tell you what else. This is gonna raise nineteen kinds\nof hell in\nCongress.\n\nLEO\nWhat doesn't?\n\nADAMLEY\nThere're already extreme Republicans who are attaching amendments to bills\ncutting off\nmilitary aid to any NATO member that signs the treaty...\n\nLEO\nThat won't happen.\n\nADAMLEY\n...and committing the U.S. to forcibly rescue any American soldier held and\ntried in such\na court. Leo, this commits the United States to a scenario...where we'd be\ninvading\nHolland!\n\nLEO\nHow much of this is about hedging our bets?\n\nADAMLEY\nIt's not about...\n\nLEO\n[hollering] Look, we set up Nuremberg! We set up the Tokyo War Crimes\nTrial. And that was\nfine until we realized the Cold War threat was gonna take precedence. So\nwhen the German\nrocket scientists came here to help us get into space...\n\nADAMLEY\nOh, please...\n\nLEO\n...we looked the other way, while SS officers followed right behind, protected\nby\nAmerican intelligence services, 'cause they were gonna help us with the\nCommunists. Oh,\nplease, Alan...So how much of this is hedging our bets?\n\nAdamley clears his throat. Leo watches, curious, as Adamley picks up a file\nfrom the\ncoffee table.\n\nADAMLEY\nRemember Operation Rolling Thunder?\n\nLEO\nYeah. I think I do, yeah.\n\nADAMLEY\n[opens the file] September 1966?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nADAMLEY\nYou were piloting an F-105 Fighter Chief. This was our first unit, 355th\nTactical Fighter\nWing out of Thailand.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nADAMLEY\nI was Forward Air Commander. I gave you your directions. [reads from file]\n\"From I.P.,\nheading 273 for 10.5 miles. Your target is north-south running bridge over\nriver, one\nkilometer to the tree line running east-west.\"\n\nLEO\n[impatiently] Yeah?\n\nAdamley shakes his head \"No.\" Leo shakes his head in confusion.\n\nLEO\n[defensively] It was a military target.\n\nADAMLEY\nIt was a civilian target. It was a dam. There were eleven civilian casualties.\n\nAdamley slaps the file down on the table. Leo sits frozen and silent for a\nlong time.\nThe reality of Adamley's words slowly sinks in. He looks increasingly stunned\nand shaken,\nstruggling to make sense of what he's just heard.\n\nLEO\nWhy did you tell me that?\n\nADAMLEY\nBecause you could be charged and tried for a war crime.\n\nLeo still can't believe what he's heard. He sighs deeply, overwhelmed,\nand puts his hand\nup to his face. Eventually he looks up at Adamley again.\n\nLEO\n[angrily] Why did you tell me that?!\n\nADAMLEY\n[coolly] All wars are crimes.\n\nAdamley sighs. Leo leans back slowly in his chair, shaking his head, and\nstares at\nAdamley.\n\nLEO\nWe've been here awhile.\n\nADAMLEY\nYeah. [stands up, buttoning his jacket]\n\nLEO\nMaybe we'll call it a day.\n\nADAMLEY\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nI'll get you some time with the President this week.\n\nADAMLEY\nI appreciate that.\n\nLEO\n[stands and sighs heavily] Thank you.\n\nAdamley looks a bit uncomfortable as he starts to leave.\n\nADAMLEY\nThank you. [leaves]\n\nLeo stands stiffly in the middle of his office, looking somewhat\ndisoriented. He stares\nout the window and rubs the back of his neck.\n\nFADE TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nBartlet and Hoyens are seated on the sofas facing each other. They're both\nleaning\nforward.\n\nBARTLET\nCan I ask you a question, just out of curiosity?\n\nHOYNES\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIf guns are meant to deter the threat of crime, what's the point of concealing\nthem?\nI mean, wouldn't you want the criminal to see that you've got a gun?\n\nHOYNES\n[puts his glass down on the table] I suppose you would.\n\nBARTLET\nThen what's the answer to that?\n\nHOYNES\nI really don't know.\n\nBARTLET\nYou don't know?\n\nHOYNES\nNo, sir. I suppose the concern has more to do with the threat to the Second\nAmendment.\n\nBARTLET\nWe can't all just agree it's a stupid-ass amendment that was written before\nthere were\nstreet lamps, much less police forces, and move on?\n\nHOYNES\n[wearily] Sir...\n\nBARTLET\nThere's no need for a citizen militia.\n\nHOYNES\nI agree with you.\n\nBARTLET\nThen say so.\n\nHOYNES\nForty percent of Americans have a gun in their home.\n\nBartlet stands up, walks across the office, and sits on the edge of his desk.\n\nBARTLET\nOnly 16% believe gun ownership is an absolute right. Only 9% believe it's\nan absolute\nwrong. There's a middle. We can win them!\n\nHOYNES\n[testily] Not when we're running the MS defense, Mr. President!\n\nBARTLET\nWhich we wouldn't have been doing if...\n\nHOYNES\nIf what, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nNothing.\n\nHoynes stands up.\n\nBARTLET\n[fuming] You outed me, John. With that trip to Nashua, with the oil\ncompanies. You wanted\npeople to start asking questions.\n\nHoynes walks toward Bartlet until he's only a few feet away.\n\nHOYNES\n[angry] I needed to start running because nobody told me I wasn't! And you\nannounced it!\nAnd I found out on television!\n\nBARTLET\n[yelling] So did my wife.\n\nHOYNES\n[yelling] This whole thing was mismanaged, sir!\n\nBARTLET\nLook...\n\nHOYNES\n[yelling] It was blown!\n\nBARTLET\nYes, it was.\n\nHOYNES\nYes, it was!\n\nThey glare at each other for several long moments.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not easy being my Vice President, is it?\n\nHOYNES\n[sighs] No, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI wouldn't think so. [walks around behind his desk and leans on it] But it's\nthe only way\nyou're gonna get the nomination. You know that, right? If I win.\n\nHOYNES\nYeah. And the only way you're gonna win is if I'm on the ticket. You know\nthat, don't\nyou, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nHoynes starts to leave.\n\nBARTLET\nYou'll go to Texas?\n\nHOYNES\n[nods] I want a seat at the table.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\n[knocks and enters] Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nCHARLIE\nThey're getting ready for you in the Briefing Room.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nCharlie goes back to his desk, but leaves the door open. Bartlet and Hoynes\naren't\nlooking at each other.\n\nHOYNES\nI'll be back in my office. Is there anything else, sir?\n\nBartlet is buttoning up his shirt cuffs. He has a stern look on his face.\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nHOYNES\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nHoynes leaves. Bartlet finishes straightening his shirt and grabs his suit\njacket off\nthe back of one of the chairs. As he leaves the Oval Office for the briefing,\nthunder\nrumbles outside and rain coats the windows.\n\nFADE TO: EXT. PARK IN WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT\nThe rain has stopped. Josh and Donna are sitting on a park bench next to a\nlarge, elegant\nfountain. They seem very tense and uncomfortable. Suddenly, Cliff appears\nfrom behind the\nfountain. Josh sees him, stands up, and walks over to him. Donna watches\nthem for a\nmoment, but then she looks away.\n\nJOSH\nThere's a coffee shop across the street. You can read it there. You've got\nan hour.\nI haven't read it, but if anything bothers you, you'll issue a subpoena in\nthe morning.\nYou'll have it back before the end of the day. If not, that's that.\n\nCLIFF\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nIf I read any of this in the newspaper, or anything happens I don't like,\nI've got the\nentries for October 4th and 5th.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat's October 4th and 5th?\n\nJOSH\n[pointing] You.\n\nCLIFF\n[nods] That's fair. Thank you.\n\nDonna is sitting stiffly on the bench, staring straight ahead. Josh gives\nCliff the\ndiary. Cliff takes it and walks away. Josh stands still for a few moments,\nwatching\nCliff. Then he turns around, walks back to the park bench, and sits down\nnext to Donna.\n\nJOSH\n[shivering, sighs] It's starting to get cold already.\n\nDonna looks at him, her eyes slightly downcast. He puts his arm behind her\non the back of\nthe bench, although she's not sitting close enough to him for his arm to\nreally be around\nher shoulders. It's a slightly awkward, but well-intentioned, gesture.\n\nJOSH\nIt's gonna be fine.\n\nDonna looks at him blankly, like she'd like to believe him. Josh looks like\nhe's trying\nto convince himself, but he hasn't quite succeeded yet. And so they sit,\nside by side,\nand wait.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

Everyone else is busy with their computer\nscreens\nand life size monitors.\n\nLEO\nWhat do you need?\n\nNANCY\nThe Commander of the Pac Fleet has informed us he's lost contact with the\nU.S.S. Portland,\nwhich is a Sea Wolf class sub.\n\nLEO\nWhat were their orders?\n\nNANCY\nThey were on a close-in a week ago. They were supposed to report in yesterday\nat 1400. They\nwere gonna surface to periscope depth and download and upload deterrence\nintelligence data.\n\nLEO\nWell, they've gone quiet. They're a submarine.\n\nNANCY\nSure. Maybe.\n\nLEO\nBut?\n\nNANCY\nThey usually call in and say they're going quiet.\n\nLEO\nWhat are the other possibilities?\n\nNANCY\nThat they've lost all power and they're drifting aimlessly in hostile waters.\n\nLEO\nWhat hostle waters?\n\nThey walk to a bright computerized map of Korea.\n\nNANCY\nYeah. The Portland was in the Yellow Sea. Their last location was 60 miles\ndue west of Seoul.\n\nLEO\nWe haven't heard from them and they're in North Korea?\n\nNANCY\nYeah.They walk to another map on the other side.\n\nLEO\nWhat do we have ready if we need to order a massive and undetectable rescue\nmission?\n\nNANCY\nThey put two DSRVs on alert from Ballast Point, San Diego. Two C-141\nStarlifters are on\nalert at NAS North Island ready to pick up a rescue crew and fittings. They'll\nmeet up\nwith two Fast Attack Sea Wolfs we have stationed off Japan, each carrying\n50 Tomahawks.\nThey practice for this all the time, but we shouldn't do it. Not yet.\n\nLEO\nWhy not?\n\nNANCY\n'Cause I think they've gone quiet.\n\nLEO\nYou said they usually call.\n\nNANCY\nThey usually do.\n\nLEO\nI've gotta tell the President.\n\nNANCY\nThe President's gonna hit the panic button, Leo.

You know why?\n\nHe throws a book to Charlie, who catches it.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's a statement about democracy?\n\nBARTLET\nIt's a profound statement about democracy. Are you mocking me?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThe thing before wasn't a crack about my height?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo. Yeah, it was.\n\nCharlie helps Bartlet put his coat on.

It's one of my all time favorite...\n\nLEO\nYeah. You can't go.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy not?\n\nLEO\nIt's one of those things we've talked about that sounds worse than it is\nbecause of your\ninexperience with the military.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat is it?\n\nLEO\nOkay. The U.S.S. Portland is a Sea Wolf class or a big nuclear submarine.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nIt has a crew of 137, is loaded down with highly classified intelligence\ngathering equipment,\nand is in the waters off North Korea.\n\nBARTLET\nRight.\n\nLEO\n[pause] We don't have it right now.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat does \"we don't have it\" mean?\n\nLEO\nWell, as you know, with our ship, our boats, and our submarines, we keep in\npretty close\ntouch with radar, sonar, satellites, radio, encrypted messages, and we don't\nhave the\nPortland right now.\n\nBARTLET\nWe don't have it?\n\nLEO\nWe do not.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd they're in North Korea?\n\nLEO\nYes. Last we heard. So we're gonna set up meetings in the next few hours. Plus,\nif anything\nhappens, I don't like people to know that you were running for election\nwhile the boat was\nout there.\n\nBARTLET\n[takes coat off] Yeah. I think I'll go ahead and cancel that trip, Leo. If\nonly to stick\naround to see how this sounds worse than it really is.\n\nLEO\nI'll stick around too.\n\nBARTLET\nI think you will.\n\nAs the agent outside closes the door, Bartlet turns and looks out to the\nhelicopter.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT.

This is... a lobby.\n\nMAGGIE\nI know what this is.\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nMAGGIE\nI have a degree from the University of Michigan.\n\nJACK\nLook, Ms. Cregg. If we give up this land, we loose our one bullet in our\ngun. We need\nto be in view of the press.\n\nC.J.\nWhat tribe are you from?\n\nJACK\nWe're Stockbridge-Munsee Indians. Like Maggie was saying, when we were moved\nto Wisconsin,\nwe signed the treaty of 1856. In return, the government was supposed to\nprotect our\nreservations, provide education and health care, and we would still be a\nsovereign nation.\nBut then the Dawes Act came.\n\nC.J.\nAnd you were forced to sell the land?\n\nJACK\nWe went from forty-six thousand acres of tribal land to eleven thousand. The\nDawes Act\nwas also supposed to civilize us. Henry Dawes said that to be civilized,\nyou must cultivate\nthe land, wear civilized clothes, drive studebaker wagons, and drink whiskey.\n\nMAGGIE\nThe drinking part was particularly constructive.\n\nC.J.\nWell, before we go any further, I should tell you, there's absolutely nothing\nI can do for you.\n\nMAGGIE\nImagine our shock.\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nMAGGIE\nIn two generations, we'll be wiped out.\n\nOn C.J., distressed--\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Hang on, wait. I am an\nexpert.\n\nSAM\nWell, I think we'd have a better chance at getting re-elected if there\nactually were four\nmillion fewer poor people, but I'm gonna talk to Bernice Collette anyway.\n\nJOSH\n[walking out from behind desk] You gonna try and get her not to recommend\nthe new model?\n\nSAM\nWell, to hold off for a while, anyway.\n\nJOSH\n[leaving office] You know Bernice?\n\nSAM\nThat's why I came to you.\n\nJOSH\n[sticking his head back in the office] She's a little tough to warm up.\n\nSAM\nI'll warm her up.\n\nThey both exit to the HALLWAY.\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nSAM\nJokes. Nicknames. That sort of thing.\n\nJOSH\nSounds like you've got a pretty good plan.\n\nSAM\nAnything else I need to know?\n\nJOSH\nDon't go through the lobby.\n\nSAM\nWhy not?\n\nJOSH\n[starting to walk away] Indians in the lobby.\n\nSAM\n[beat] Is that code?\n\nJOSH\nNo. There are Indians in the lobby.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nJosh walks away.

Toby enters.\n\nTOBY\n[walking towards desk] Good morning, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nTOBY\nBefore anything else, I was hoping I could impose on you for as much\ninformation you could\nspare about making a turkey.\n\nBARTLET\nThis is some sort of pre-emptive psychological thing?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's not going to work.\n\nTOBY\nYeah. You're gonna see, on next week's message calendar, there's a notation\nabout a new\nfederal initiative to provide low-cost cell phones to neighborhood watch\ngroups.\n\nBARTLET\nI saw the message calendar. I'm having some difficulty navigating the\ncolor-coding.\n\nTOBY\nThe colors are for areas - Blue is education... Green is economy, it's a\nquick glance way\nto let us know if we're getting enough hits on our issues.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, there should be a separate color for things I don't care about.\n\nTOBY\nLike what?\n\nBARTLET\nProviding low-cost cell phone service to neighborhood watch groups.\n\nTOBY\nIt's important.\n\nBARTLET\nReally?\n\nTOBY\nYou spot a crime, you gonna go to a pay phone?\n\nBARTLET\nThere's nothing wrong with the policy, it's just too small. I could fund\nthis initiative\nout of my pocket.\n\nTOBY\nIt's ten million dollars.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo could fund it out of his pocket. Shouldn't this be local government,\nlike the YMCA\nor something?\n\nTOBY\nWe have an idea, which we have reason to believe is popular, which is,\nthat in addition\nto passing large and abstract pieces of legislation-\n\nBARTLET\nWe pass minute, but easy to understand.\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHow popular?\n\nTOBY\nEighty-two percent.\n\nBARTLET\nGet out of here.\n\nTOBY\nHand to God.\n\nBARTLET\nBring me that polling data.\n\nToby gets up to leave, then turns back to Bartlet.\n\nTOBY\nWhat kind of stuffing are we talking about?\n\nBARTLET\nCornbread, oysters, water chestnuts, andouille sausage.\n\nTOBY\nYou gonna cook on the inside or separate?\n\nBARTLET\nInside.\n\nTOBY\nYou better make sure it cooks.\n\nBARTLET\nIt'll cook.\n\nTOBY\nIf it doesn't cook, people are gonna get sick.\n\nBARTLET\nIt'll cook.\n\nTOBY\nThey'll be very, very sick.\n\nBARTLET\nI've got it covered. Anything else?\n\nTOBY\nYou know about the new OMB definitions?\n\nBARTLET\nI know they're coming out. What's it going to look like?\n\nTOBY\nDepends.

It's an 800 number, the phones are staffed by experts.\n\nBARTLET\nAre you kidding me?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nGod, I'm sorry, I love my country.

The current one.\n\nThey enter SAM'S OFFICE.\n\nBERNICE\nIn 1963, an eastern European immigrant named Mollie Orshansky, who was\nworking over in\nsocial security, came up with it. Food was the most costly living expense\nwhere she came from.\n\nSAM\nOur cost of living formula for the last 40 years has been based on life in\nPoland during\nthe Cold War?\n\nBERNICE\nThis is what I'm talking about. I mean, food doesn't account for one-third\nof a family's\nbudget. Housing is more expensive than food. The current model also doesn't\ntake into\naccount transportation and health insurance. So let's call the current model\nthe old\nmodel and sign off on the new model.\n\nSAM\nAll right. Sit down.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

And, no offense, Josh, but\nneither can you.\n\nJOSH\nYou don't have a defendant.\n\nFARRAGUT\nYou can't ask me to weaken my stance.\n\nJOSH\nI know. 'Cause the Georgia 4th is tough enough for a Democrat without\nappearing as\nif he's against the death penalty.\n\nFARRAGUT\nI'm not against the death penalty.\n\nJOSH\nI said appearing. The only way to combat that is with TV time.

On your behalf, I have responded to polling information\ntelling me what\nI should wear, and what I should say, to say nothing of the fact that I have\nbeen subpoenaed\nto answer questions before Congress on how I secretly kept you alive.

If\nwe have to\nmake a to-do about it being forced prostitution, isn't there a chance it\ncould be spun\nthat we're condoning prostitution?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nHow much of a chance?\n\nC.J.\nIt'll happen.\n\nJOSH\nCause Amy'll make it happen.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWell, this is a whole new thing then...\n\nTOBY\n[appearing at the door] Leo told me.\n\nC.J.\nClose the door.\n\nJOSH\nTold you what?\n\nC.J.\nClose the door.\n\nToby closes the door.\n\nC.J.\nThere was a presumptive positive on some cattle in Nebraska.\n\nJOSH\nWhat does that mean?\n\nC.J.\nWe have to wait 72 hours for a test.\n\nJOSH\nYou're talking about a disease?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nYou're kidding me.\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nMad cow?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nOh my god, you're kidding me!\n\nC.J.\nReally, no.\n\nJOSH\nI guess if the door's closed we're not saying anything yet?\n\nTOBY\nThat's what we're here to talk about.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do you think?\n\nC.J.\nYou know we have an extra 1.5 billion dollars we weren't counting on?\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nC.J.\nThere's an extra 1.5 billion. In Qumar, when a woman gets raped, she'll\ngenerally get\nbeaten by her husband and sons as a punishment so at some point we should\ntalk about\nhow to spend the 1.5 billion they're giving us.\n\nShe walks over to her desk and sits.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, so, should we tell anybody?\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nBartlet is in a meeting with advisors in the Oval Office.\n\nBARTLET\n[reading] All right. Unfunded mandates.\n\nLEO\nThis is where the federal government forces localities to do stuff that\nisn't at all\ninterested in paying the bill.\n\nBARTLET\nDon't give me their grumbles.\n\nMAN\nAccording to Frank Siegel, Danville, Virginia with a population of 55,000\nspent 13,800\nstaff hours and $176,000 complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nBARTLET\nAre employees in wheelchairs supposed to work in the parking lot?\n\nMAN\nNo, sir. Siegel thinks it's unfair that the federal government-\n\nBARTLET\nHow much would it cost the federal government to amend the unfunded mandates\nwe format\nto cover all unfunded mandates?\n\nMAN\nTens of billions, I would think.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's find out for sure then tell Siegel to sit down and shut up.\n\nMAN\nYes, sir.\n\nLEO\nAnything else?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nADVISORS\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nLeo shuts the door behind them leaving and goes back to sit beside Bartlet,\nwhere they\nsit leaning in to each other.\n\nBARTLET\nSo paint a picture for me, would you?\n\nLEO\nWe find the source of the problem, which'll be the feed. We buy the cattle\nand slaughter them.\n\nBARTLET\nHow many?\n\nLEO\nTens of thousands.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's the live cattle. What about the beef?\n\nLEO\nWell, FSIS will do a Class One recall and get it off the shelves. Not that\nthey need to.\nNobody's gonna buy beef for a couple of years.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's a hundred and fifty billion dollar industry. What's the West going\nto do for a living?\n\nLEO\nWell this generation of ranchers is done. They won't get back on their feet.\n\nBARTLET\nPeople have known about this disease; they're still eating beef in record\nnumbers.\n\nLEO\nThat's cause it's been on the other side of the ocean. Once we announce a\npositive,\nsteak houses are done. Fast food is done.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd then the corn and soybean growers, right?\n\nLEO\nThe dominos don't end on this.\n\nBARTLET\nAny good news?\n\nLEO\nFor fishermen.\n\nBARTLET\nSo we've got frightened parents, rising food prices, public panic, massive\nlayoffs,\nand something we've never had to worry about before, we're wondering when\nthe next\ncase is gonna happen. The most costly disruptions...\n\nLEO\nYeah?\n\nBARTLET\nAlways happen when something we take completely for granted stops working\nfor a minute.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\n[sighs] Okay.\n\nLEO\n[as they both get up and he starts to leave] Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, hey - do you know when we passed the Clean Water Act?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nHow could you not know that?\n\nLEO\nMy water's clean, I don't ask questions.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat'd I just say?\n\nLEO\nI wasn't really listening.\n\nBARTLET\n[as they exit the Oval Office] All right.\n\nLEO\nThank you.\n\nBartlet walks over to Charlie's desk. Charlie stops working and looks up.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nNope, nothing.\n\nBartlet goes behind Charlie's area and takes a book off the shelf.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou sure there's nothing you need?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nBartlet pauses and watches Charlie working.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know, Charlie...\n\nCHARLIE\n[quickly] Yeah...\n\nBARTLET\nHistory can't be reduced to dates and names.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, I'm pretty sure this final can.\n\nBARTLET\nNah. I'm starting you out with a copy of the speech George Perkins March\nused in 1845\nto rouse the agricultural community of Rutland, Vermont. Then you're going\nto need to\nstudy on the word \"ecology,\" as coined by the German biologist Ernst Heikl.\n\nCHARLIE\nAm I being punished for something?\n\nBARTLET\n[walking back to the Oval] Better in the original German, of course, but\nobviously the\ntranslation will be fine.\n\nCHARLIE\n[muttering to himself] Good.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - DAY\nSam and two men meet.\n\nSAM\nHey.\n\nTOM STARKS\nSam\n\nMAN\nSam, how you doing? [They shake hands.]\n\nSAM\nGood. Thanks for coming down. Come on back.\n\nMAN\nSo I got a funny joke the President could do about telling people not to\nwear seatbelts.\n\nSAM\nWell he didn't tell people not to wear their seatbelts.\n\nMAN\nHe should say, \"Maybe I should go back to concealing my health.\"\n\nSAM\n[pausing] That's a good one. He can use it at the Rotary Club.\n\nTOM\nBy the way, Josh Lyman shouldn't make jokes about Rotarians. They're good\npeople.\n\nThey reach SAM'S OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nHe feels bad about that.\n\nTOM\nThey volunteer their time even though nobody's got enough of it.\n\nSAM\nHe's gonna apologize.\n\nTOM\nI'm a Rotarian. My dad's a Rotarian.\n\nSAM\nMy dad's an Elk.\n\nTOM\nElks are okay.\n\nSAM\nSo. Anticipating this might become a thing, I wanted to float the idea of\na national\nseatbelt law. What's the Democratic Leadership going to say?\n\nMAN\nThey're gonna say no.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nMAN\nWell, first of all, the Democratic Leadership doesn't do damage control for\nthe President.\n\nSAM\nWell, you know, I think it's about more than damage control. Only 68% of\ndrivers are\nwearing their seatbelts. We get that up to 90% and we save 5,000 lives a year.\n\nMAN\nAnd if we get kids to eat their spinach, they'll be as strong as Popeye.\n\nTOM\nWe've done driver safety. We've done food drives. We've done physical fitness.\n\nSAM\nWho?\n\nTOM\nThe Rotary Club.\n\nSAM\nHe really is gonna apologize, Tom.\n\nMAN\nSam...\n\nSAM\nLook, secondary seatbelt laws don't work. You can only fine someone if you've\nstopped\nthem for something else. Isn't it time for a tough law?\n\nMAN\nTo make up for a bonehead comment at a fundraiser?\n\nTOM\nThe governors don't like it. It's federalism run amok.\n\nSAM\nThe governors don't have a vote in Congress.\n\nTOM\nBut the Congressmen do, and they're not going to vote for it either.\n\nSAM\nOkay, well then, this is a shorter meeting than I thought it would be. Thanks.\n\nTOM\nYou won't catch a Rotarian not wearing a seatbelt. An Elk, maybe.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\nDonna walks in, going through some papers.\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nDONNA\nLeo's office wanted you to know that the OMB's gonna do a quick report on\nexpanding\nunfunded mandates and it doesn't mean anything but they're doing it anyway.\n\nJOSH\nMy tax dollars hard at work.\n\nDONNA\n[leaving] I'll be at my desk.\n\nJOSH\nSay Donna, you've worked as a prostitute.\n\nDONNA\n[turning back] Yeah?\n\nJOSH\nLet's just say.\n\nDONNA\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\nWhy should what you do be against the law?\n\nDONNA\nWell, in this country you're not allowed to buy and sell people.\n\nJOSH\nYou're not selling yourself, you're renting out your body.\n\nDONNA\nYou're not allowed to do that either.\n\nJOSH\nDon't fashion models do it every day?\n\nDONNA\nIt's different.\n\nJOSH\nIt's only different because we say it's different. When you get a massage,\nisn't it just\na matter of degrees?\n\nDONNA\nLots of things are just a matter of degrees.\n\nJOSH\nWouldn't legalizing prostitution allow women to unionize and get access to\nsocial services\nand health care benefits and create some control over the industry?\n\nDONNA\nYou think if you make prostitution legal then prostitutes are going to\nsuddenly want every\none to know they're prostitutes?\n\nJOSH\n[pausing] Hmm.\n\nDONNA\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nThe rare valid point.\n\nDONNA\n[pointing towards the door] I'll be back on my street corner.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY\nToby enters and greets three USF veterans.\n\nTOBY\nOkay, round two. I'm Toby Ziegler, I'll be your referee.\n\nBARNEY LANG\n[shaking his hand] Toby, I'm Barney Lang, National Commander. We spoke on\nthe phone.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nBARNEY\nPlease meet Ed Ramsey and Ronald Crookshank. These are two of our regional\ndirectors.\n\nTOBY\nWelcome to the White House.\n\nThey all sit down.\n\nRONALD CROOKSHANK\nBeen here before. My unit was invited by Franklin Roosevelt. [pointing\ntowards Toby]\nThat chair used to be over there. [pointing to the corner of the room]\n\nTOBY\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\nBARNEY\nToby, before we get started, could I hit you up for a personal favor?\n\nTOBY\nI don't think the President is available for pictures today, but I can check.\n\nBARNEY\nNo, it's my buddy, Arthur Holly. He's been in a wheelchair cause he lost\nhis left leg;\nand the wheelchair is falling apart. We've been doing a pretty good job with\nduct tape,\nbut the guy could really use a new one, and Medicaid is dragging its feet\non this.\n\nTOBY\nLeave me his information on a piece of paper. I can make a phone call for you.\n\nBARNEY\nI appreciate that, son. Thank you.\n\nTOBY\nOkay. Tell me the point you find most offensive and would like to see pulled\nfrom the exhibit.\n\nED RAMSEY\nWell there are a number of points.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's at the top of the list?\n\nBARNEY\nSections that have the overreaching message of a vengeful America and a\nvictimized Japan.\n\nTOBY\nWell you don't want to ignore the effects of the bomb.\n\nED\nWe don't want to ignore facts. But in that particular case we don't agree\nwith their\nversion of the facts.\n\nTOBY\nThe 63,000?\n\nC.J. open the door and slips in unnoticed.\n\nED\nThey say 63,000 American lives would have been lost if we had invaded. Marshall\ntold\nTruman that a ground offensive would take the lives of at least 250,000.\n\nTOBY\nWell there's some evidence to suggest that Marshall told Truman that and\nsome estimates\nsay 150,000. Some say 268,000.\n\nC.J.\nThere are discrepancies.\n\nC.J. had just walked in. Toby, a bit startled, turns and looks at her.\n\nTOBY\nI didn't see you there.\n\nC.J. approaches the group and they all stand.\n\nTOBY\nThis is C.J. Cregg.\n\nBARNEY\nI'm Barney Lang. Ed Ramsey, Ronald Crookshank.\n\nC.J.\nGood to meet you.\n\nTOBY\nYou need anything?\n\nC.J.\nI just came by to listen.\n\nTOBY\n[turning back to the veterans] Before I forget, I want to put you three in\na room with\nthe exhibit directors from the Smithsonian. Can I do it today?\n\nBARNEY\nSure.\n\nTOBY\nStay by a phone. [They start up as to leave.] Okay.\n\nC.J.\nCan I interrupt for a second, Toby?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nMr. Ramsey, I saw on your information you were in the 10th Armored Division.\n\nED\nPrivate first class, 10th Armored Division, 3rd Army, second World War.\n\nC.J.\nYou fought in the battle of the bulge, sir.\n\nED\nYes, I did. My unit broke through the German Seventh Army's buffer, which\nwas critical\nin winning. That was the moment we beat the Nazis on the western front.\n\nC.J.\nThat was a hell of a moment.\n\nShe sits, and the others do too.\n\nED\nI have a granddaughter like you. She's a chemist.\n\nC.J.\nCan I ask you to imagine something?\n\nED\nI suppose.\n\nC.J.\nImagine if you weren't as successful as you were. Imagine, say, that Hitler\nhad taken\nAntwerp and we'd lost the Battle of the Bulge and Germany held the western\nfront.\n\nED\nIt wouldn't have mattered. The Russians crushed them on the eastern front. They\nwouldn't\nhave won the war.\n\nC.J.\nNo, but even if the Russians had kicked them out of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria,\nthey could\nhave held onto France, maybe kept Italy, certainly they could have defended\nGermany.\n\nED\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nNow it's six decades later, and while they didn't conquer Europe the Nazis\nexist as a\nrecognized government in some small corner of the European union.\n\nED\nThat would never have happened.\n\nC.J.\nReally?\n\nED\nThey killed a quarter of my unit. They killed a third of my classmates from\nErasmus\nHigh School.\n\nWhile the veteran is speaking, Toby watches C.J. intently.\n\nED\nWe never would have allowed it--\n\nC.J.\nWe did it in Cambodia.\n\nTOBY\nC.J., knock it off.\n\nC.J.\nYou're protesting because you think the Smithsonian isn't paying proper\nrespect to what\nyou and the soldiers of the 10th Armored, 3rd Army risked and lost your\nlives for six\ndecades ago. How would you feel, in the hypothetical I just described,\nif I told you that\nat my press briefing at the end of the day I was announcing that we were\nselling tanks,\nmissiles, and fighter jets to the Nazis?\n\nTOBY\nExcuse me. [whispering to C.J. and standing] Step outside.\n\nC.J. walks out behind him. When they reach the HALLWAY, Toby starts.\n\nTOBY\nLook...\n\nC.J.\nYou know, if I was living in Qumar I wouldn't be able to say \"Shove it up\nyour ass, Toby.\"\nBut since I'm not, shove it up your ass, Toby.\n\nToby stands in a trail of dust as C.J. chalks one up for the sisterhood and\nwalks on.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - DAY\nBartlet and Sam are walking outside.\n\nBARTLET\nYou really wanna talk about the lawsuit in Colorado?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou hear about the lawyer who opened a chain of dry cleaners? \"Press your\nlawsuit while\nyou wait?\" [pause] There was a better joke in there someplace, right?\n\nSAM\nProbably not.\n\nTwo Secret Service members open the doors to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. Sam and\nBartlet enter.\n\nSAM\nSir--\n\nBARTLET\nDoctrine of Sovereign Immunity. You can't sue the king. We brought it over\nfrom England.\n\nSAM\nYeah, but he's not immune from the court of public opinion.\n\nBARTLET\nForgot to bring that one over.\n\nThey enter THE OVAL OFFICE. Charlie is standing at Bartlet's desk, looking\nat papers.\n\nSAM\nThe RNC'll have a press conference.\n\nBARTLET\nThe RNC has a press conference when I sneeze.\n\nSAM\nI think we need to come out for a strong national seatbelt law.\n\nBARTLET\nCongress won't pass it.\n\nHe walks behind his desk and begins to sign papers. Charlie walks to another\nspot in the room.\n\nSAM\nI'm not saying we need to have a law. I'm just saying we need to come out\nfor it. It'll end\nthe question of where you stand.\n\nBARTLET\nPeople know where I stand. If they don't know, they can ask me.\n\nSAM\nYou were governor of New Hampshire, sir, the only state--\n\nBARTLET\nAnd I was for it then. Never did anything about it because nobody wanted\nit. And, frankly,\nwhy waste time in Capitol?\n\nSAM\nC.J.'ll get asked about it at the five o'clock briefing.\n\nBARTLET\nI can't be responsible every time somebody irrationally twists my\nmeaning. People are\nresponsible for themselves.\n\nBartlet walks over to Charlie and hands him a folder. Charlie hands Bartlet\nanother folder,\nthen walks away. Bartlet walks over to Sam.\n\nBARTLET\nToday's cars are safer than they've ever been. They've all got air bags,\nthey've all got\nseatbelts, and they're all crash tested from here to Tuesday. All that's\nleft is personal\nbehavior and bad luck, and, I'm not responsible for either one. And, Sam,\nif Mrs. Landingham w\nas here right now, she'd say the exact same thing. You know what I'm saying?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't blame this woman for suing me. I'm not a king, and I'm not sure the\nlaw should\ntreat me like one. Though certainly for the moment I don't mind. I'm not\nblaming her.\nShe's got to go someplace with her grief and her anger. The ones who should\nbe horsewhipped\nwith a horsewhip are the ones exploiting her grief for political gain,\nand I'm not getting\ndown with those guys.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\n[walks back to behind his desk] Let Congress pass that law. I'll sign it.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\n[to Charlie] Yeah, let's go. Get Leo.\n\nSAM\nThank you, Mr. President. [turns and walks out of the office]\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nToby and Josh enter.\n\nTOBY\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nIsn't there a joke to be had with lawsuits and dry cleaners? I've been\nworking on it all day.\n\nJOSH\nYou've been working on other stuff though too, right?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nC.J. and Leo enter.\n\nC.J.\nGood evening, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, what do we think? When do you tell the public what you know?\n\nC.J.\nI think it's right now.\n\nTOBY\nAnd I think it's when you know something. I think absolute confirmation has\nto be the rule\nwhen we're talking about public panic.\n\nJOSH\nAre we sure there's gonna be public panic if we're only saying there's a\nchance? We think\nmaybe, usually it's negative.\n\nTOBY\nI do. 'Cause we're not talking about sushi, it's hamburgers. I'm not kidding\naround,\nit's... these things. The everyday things. The everyday American things. The\n99 cent things\nthat, when you suddenly have to be afraid of them, strike at the center of\nour equilibrium.\n\nLEO\nI'll tell you what else. Democrats aren't exactly loved by the beef industry\nto begin with.\nWe're gonna get killed for causing false panic.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, what we say now is gonna be measured against the facts, the consequenses\nof which will\nbe far worse if we don't say anything and it goes the other way.\n\nTOBY\nI disagree.\n\nC.J.\n[to Toby] Then pretend for a moment that the cow has MS.\n\nA pause. Everyone turns and looks at C.J.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I don't think I will.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Leo] Something going on with them?\n\nLEO\nI think they can hear you. They're standing right in front of you.\n\nC.J.\nThat was a bad analogy, I apologize. What I meant was that the public will\nnot forgive a\nPresident who withheld information that could have helped them or saved\nlives. Second,\nin a crisis, people need to feel like soldiers, not victims. Third, information\nbreeds\nconfidence. Silence breeds fear. That's my argument.\n\nToby, Josh, and Leo all turn to Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\n[pause] If it comes from the President--\n\nTOBY\nIt shouldn't come from the President.\n\nLEO\nIt shouldn't even come from the White House.\n\nJOSH\nIt should come from Health and Human Services.\n\nLEO\nHow about the secretary, mid-level?\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, that's what we'll do then.\n\nLEO, JOSH, and C.J.\nThank you, sir.\n\nThey all turn to exit.\n\nBARTLET\nToby.\n\nToby turns back aorund.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's going on with the Smithsonian?\n\nTOBY\nIt'll be fine, sir.\n\nLeo, Josh, and C.J. exit. C.J. closes the door behind her. Charlie enters.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere are you leading them?\n\nHe walks out from behind his desk and to Toby. Charlie goes through papers\non Bartlet's\ndesk and watches Bartlet and Toby.\n\nTOBY\nNot to turn a blind eye to the dark points of history, for sure, but I think\nthere's a\ntime and place for that, and this isn't it.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're changing.\n\nTOBY\nNo, I'm not.\n\nBARTLET\nYes, you are.\n\nTOBY\nA very, very little bit.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nTOBY\nUh, Mr. President? Could you point me in the right direction on something? One\nof the vets\nwho was here has a buddy whose wheelchair's falling apart. Who can get\nsomething done\novernight at Medicaid?\n\nBARTLET\nAh, Toby. We've gotta straighten out Medicaid.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know, after the Civil War, veterans had to come to D.C. to get their\npensions? They had\nto visit the office personally. They waited for a clerk to look through all\nthe Civil War\nrecords until their papers were found. You know what their papers were bound\nwith?\n\nTOBY\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nRed tape. That's where it comes from.\n\nTOBY\nI didn't know that.\n\nBARTLET\nGo and apologize to C.J. for whatever you did.\n\nHe puts his hand on Toby's shoulder and starts to walk him out of the office.\n\nTOBY\nI didn't do anything.\n\nBARTLET\nLike that matters.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, sir. [exits]\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's next?\n\nHe looks up at Charlie, who is staring at him.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nCHARLIE\nYou know, sir, that story about red tape and Medicaid was interesting, but...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat? [checks his watch and walks over to Charlie]\n\nCHARLIE\nNothing. I'm sorry, you've got economic advisors in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nBARTLET\nIt was interesting, but what?\n\nCHARLIE\nBut the man just wanted a wheelchair. Toby's trying to get him a wheelchair.\n\nBARTLET\nI forgot.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, I forgot. Get the information from Toby, I'll make the call myself.\n\nBartlet walks behind his desk and Charlie walks out from behind it.\n\nCHARLIE\nMaybe the man can wheel himself around on a book by German biologist Ernst\nHeikl.\n\nBARTLET\nGet the information. Get the director of the CMSO on the phone.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nHe starts to walk out. Bartlet looks at the papers on his desk for a few\nmoments before\nlooking back up at Charlie.\n\nBARTLET\n1972.\n\nCHARLIE\n[stops walking and turns around] I'm sorry, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nIs when we passed the Clean Water Act.\n\nCHARLIE\nThank you, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know nothing about the Visigoths.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd I know everything.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nCharlie turns and walks out of the office.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

But I know of no little girl, and neither do you, who says\n\"I wanna be a\nprostitute when I grow up.\" They do it 'cause they're forced to out of\neconomic\ncircumstances. And dire economic need is a form of coersion.\n\nJOSH\nBut the guys who breaks into my apartment and steals my stereo does it for\nthe same reason.\n\nAMY\nAnd he's going to jail.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, because he broke into my apartment and stole my stereo, and nobody\nwants that to\nhappen to them.

Please take\nyour seats.\n\nC.J.\nHey Nancy.\n\nNANCY\nI understand you're troubled by the arms sale.\n\nC.J. walks to behind her desk. She begins going through papers.\n\nNANCY\nThe Nazis were a bad analogy. We're not fighting a war with Qumar.\n\nC.J.\nWell, this isn't the point, but we will. Of course we will. Of course we'll\nbe fighting\na war with Qumar one day, and you know it, so...well, at least we'll be\nfamiliar with the\nweapons they're using.\n\nNANCY\nWe need Khalifa Airbase. We refuel there, and we keep air radar.\n\nC.J.\nWe don't need it, it's convenient.\n\nNANCY\nC.J.--\n\nC.J.\nWe don't need it. We've got Turkey, we've got Bahraine, we've got Deigo\nGarcia.\nQumar's convenient.\n\nNANCY\nYes, it's convenient.\n\nC.J.\nThey beat women, Nancy. They hate women. The only reason they keep Qumari\nwomen alive\nis to make more Qumari men.\n\nNANCY\nSo what do you want me to do about it?\n\nC.J.\nHow about instead of suggesting that we sell the guns to them, suggesting\nthat we shoot\nthe guns at them? And by the way, not to change the subject, but how are we\nsupposed to\nhave any moral credibility when we talk about gun control and making sure\nthat guns don't\nget in the hands of the wrong people? God, Nancy! What the hell are we\ndefining as the\nright people?\n\nNANCY\nThis is the real world, and we can't isolate our enemies.\n\nC.J.\nI know about the real world, and I'm not suggesting we isolate them.\n\nNANCY\nYou're suggesting we eliminate them.\n\nC.J.\nI have a briefing.\n\nShe picks up her folder and walks out of the office to the Press Room. Nancy\nfollows.\n\nNANCY\nYou're suggesting that--\n\nC.J.\nI'm not suggesting anything. I don't suggest foreign policy around here.\n\nNANCY\nYou are right now.\n\nC.J.\nIt's the twenty-first century, Nancy. The world's gotten smaller. I don't\nknow how we can\ntolerate this kind of suffering anymore, particularly when all it does is\ncontinue the cycle\nof anti-American hatred. But that's not the point, either.\n\nNANCY\nWhat's the point?\n\nThey stop walking.\n\nC.J.\nThe point is that apartheid was an Easthampton clambake compared to what we\nlaughingly refer\nto as the life these women lead. And if we had sold M1-A1s to South Africa\nfifteen years ago,\nyou'd have set the building on fire. Thank God we never needed to refuel in\nJohannesburg!\n\nNANCY\n[nods] It's a big world, C.J.

Many, if not most of us, were surprised by the President's\nannouncement\nthat he's been diagnosed with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis for\nseven years\nand never mentioned it while asking us to vote for him for President but\nmore surprising\nstill, if not stunning is that his medical condition could have been kept\na secret from\nthose campaign aides closest to him. In this age when the most minute details\nof a\ncandidate's life are brought into the light in a business where secrets\naren't kept\nsecret very long this Committee would like to know, quite candidly how it\nwas pulled off.\nDid people lie?

So why shouldn't I send\ntroops in?\n\nGOVERNOR\nBecause, due respect, Mr. President but you do it without my consent and\nit's a clear\nviolation of State's rights and you would have said the same thing when you\nwere the\nGovernor of New Hampshire.\n\nBARTLET\nThis doesn't happen in New Hampshire.\n\nGOVERNOR\nYou got a pretty big black population in New Hampshire, do you?\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll meet again this afternoon.

You're smiling.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nDEARBORN\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nBecause at this point there wasn't much of a high command. All we'd done is\nshow a strong\nthird in Iowa. We were working out of storefront.\n\nCUT TO: INT. STOREFRONT - FLASHBACK - DAY\nToby and C.J. are throwing a basketball back and forth to each other.\n\nTOBY\nYou got to pop the ball. You got to pop it.\n\nC.J.\nI'm popping it.\n\nTOBY\nNo, you're not.\n\nSAM\nSo my feeling-\n\nTOBY\nYeah?\n\nSAM\nIs that we're fine playing this song in South Carolina.\n\nC.J.\nI agree.\n\nTOBY\nPop it.\n\nSAM\nAs long as all he's doing is running against Wiley it's fine that he doesn't\nseem like a\nreal candidate.\n\nTOBY\nIt's when Wiley drops out and he's running against Hoynes.\n\nSAM\nRight. They'll cover us all the way to South Dakota. Suddenly, we don't want\nto be quaint\nanymore. People want to know \"Is this guy for real?\"\n\nSAM\nWe got to show them we're an honest-to-God alternative. We got to show them\nwe're big time.\n\nSam claps and holds out his hands for C.J. to throw him the ball. C.J. turns\ntowards Sam\nand throws the ball past him and through the window behind him. C.J. gawks\nat the hole in\nthe window.\n\nC.J.\nCan we get an intern over here?\n\nSAM\nWhat about this. A series of major, national policy addresses. We work with\nJosh; we pick\nthree issues.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, and we should start projecting the image that he thinks he's for real.\n\nC.J.\nWe'll release his tax returns, put all his stocks in a blind trust.\n\nSAM\nYou know what else?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nHe should take a physical.\n\nC.J.\nAbsolutely. He's got ten years on Hoynes. We should release a medical report.\n\nTOBY\nI'll take it to Leo.\n\nSAM\nOkay, guys, let's go. Let's be working. Somebody want to get the ball?\n\nFADE TO: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\nA large flag outside the headquarters flaps in the breeze. It's now late\nevening. A light snow\nis falling. Bartlet and Abbey walk side by side down the front steps of the\nbuilding and along\nthe street. A police car is parked a few blocks away, waiting for them,\nlights flashing.\n\nABBEY\nI like some of these new people. I'm gonna miss them.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nABBEY\n[chuckles softly] Josh Lyman's special. Sam Seaborn's very funny.\n\nBARTLET\nWhich one's he?\n\nABBEY\nThe young one.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're all young.\n\nABBEY\nMmm...\n\nBARTLET\nListen, they want me to do some things before South Dakota.\n\nABBEY\n[long pause] South Carolina's next.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, we're lookin' past that.\n\nABBEY\nWhat do they want you to do?\n\nThey reach the car. A police officer opens the door to the back seat. Abbey\nturns to look\nat her husband.\n\nBARTLET\nFull financial disclosure...\n\nABBEY\nI have no problem with that...\n\nBARTLET\nThey want me to take a physical.\n\nShe stares at him, a tiny glint of concern in her eyes.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's a physical right now gonna show?\n\nABBEY\n[trying to act casual] It'll, uh... Nothing... Um... You're in remission.\n\nBARTLET\n[shakes his head] I'm not lying to anybody, Abbey. I'm taking a physical -\na physical which\nI'm under no legal obligation to take. I'm doing it voluntarily.\n\nABBEY\n[nods, still looks concerned] Yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nNow is when people are listening. I'll make my speeches, get whooped on\nSuper Tuesday,\nand we'll all go home.\n\nAbbey smiles at him and he leans forward to kiss her. She gets in the car. He\ncloses the door\nfor her. The officer starts the engine and drives away. Bartlet stands there,\nhands in his\ncoat pockets, watching her go.\n\nDEARBORN [VO]\nWe're headed for South Carolina. We're planning for South Dakota. And\nMrs. Bartlet - excuse me,\nDr. Bartlet - has yet to mention to anyone that her husband has multiple\nsclerosis.\n\nFADE TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE, OUTER OVAL OFFICE - PRESENT\nBartlet is watching the hearing on the TV near Charlie's desk.\n\nBARTLET\n[softly, with regret] The things we do to women.\n\nBRUNO\n[on TV] The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman\nBuchanan.\n\nBartlet puts his reading glasses in his jacket pocket and goes outside\nthrough the French doors.\n\nBUCHANAN\n[on TV] Mr. Chairman, with your permission, I'd like to skip any statement\nand move right\ninto my questioning.\n\nBRUNO\n[on TV] The chair thanks the Gentleman for his consideration.\n\nBUCHANAN\n[on TV] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. HALLWAYS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS BULLPEN - DAY\nPresent day. Christmas lights are hanging throughout the Bullpen. Several TVs,\nperched on\ntop of the filing cabinets, are tuned to the hearings, the sounds of which\nfill the hallway.\nAides are bustling around Sam, who's getting some coffee. Josh walks up to\nhim.\n\nJOSH\nListen...\n\nSAM\nThey're coming back from the break.\n\nJOSH\n[sighs] Yeah.\n\nThey walk down the hall. Josh begins to say something but he stops when Sam\nkeeps talking.\n\nSAM\nYou know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about when we threw that\nbasketball\nthrough the window of the first campaign headquarters in Manchester.\n\nJOSH\n[distracted] I wasn't there. I heard about it.\n\nSAM\nYou weren't throwing the ball around with us?\n\nJOSH\nIt was you, Toby, and C.J.\n\nSAM\n[chuckles, smiles to himself] What that must've looked like from the point\nof view of\nsomeone walking down the sidewalk...\n\nJOSH\nI need somebody in the steel lobby to speak to Darren Gibson right away -\nsometime toward\nthe end of this hour.\n\nSAM\n[suddenly all business] Jim Jericho.\n\nThey walk in SAM'S OFFICE.\n\nJOSH\nJim Jericho's who I had. He had to leave town. His wife is sick. Who else\ndo we have?\nOne of our people?\n\nSam is standing behind his desk, facing Josh.\n\nSAM\nNick Grindell.\n\nJosh shakes his head, sighs, and looks at the floor.\n\nSAM\nWell, I'll get to somebody. What's this about?\n\nJOSH\n[quickly glances up at Sam] Nothing. [turns to leave, rubbing his forehead]\n\nSAM\nIt's not about nothin'. You want Gibson out of the room.\n\nJOSH\n[standing in the doorway, turns to look at Sam] I'd like 'em all out of the\nroom.\n[starts walking away again]\n\nSAM\nJosh. [Josh turns to look at him. Pause] What's Gibson got?\n\nJOSH\n[stares at Sam for several long moments] You'll get a guy for me?\n\nSAM\n[stares, nods] Yeah.\n\nJosh turns and walks away. Sam sets his coffee down and sits at his desk. He\nopens a drawer,\npulls out a thick address book, and flips through the pages which contain\nan uncharacteristic\namount of messy scribbling. The TV next to his desk is tuned to the\nhearings. The Chairman\nof the Committee, CONGRESSMAN JOSEPH \"PHIL\" Bruno, gavels the committee back\ninto session.\n\nBRUNO\n[on TV] I would like our ten-minute breaks to be closer to fifteen minutes\nthan they are\nto a half hour...\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY\n\nBRUNO [cont.]\n...and, with that, the Chair recognizes the Gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\nCONGRESSMAN ERICKSON\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to complement you on your leadership\nof this committee.\n\nBruno nods and silently mouths \"Thank you\" to Erickson. Erickson's hands\nare clasped in front\nof him, his tone a bit smug.\n\nERICKSON\nNow, Mr. McGarry. You're familiar, are you not, with Article II, Section 1,\nClause 6 of the\nU.S. Constitution?\n\nLeo and Jordan stare blankly at Erickson. Leo pauses, then places his hand\nover his microphone\nand slowly turns toward Jordan. Jordan turns her microphone away from herself\nand leans toward Leo.\nThey keep their voices low, whispering.\n\nLEO\nWe're gonna have to do this again.\n\nJORDAN\nHe's being snotty?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nSeated among the committee members, Cliff sighs and tries not to look annoyed.\n\nLEO\nSo... I was thinking maybe... you know... dinner...\n\nJORDAN\n[annoyed] Listen to me. I don't like this. You pay me six hundred and fifty\ndollars an hour.\nYou tell me everything.\n\nLEO\n[hint of a devilish smile] Well, what do I have to pay to only tell you some\nthings?\n\nJORDAN\nI don't know. But you have to pay it to another lawyer.\n\nLEO\nSo what are you saying about dinner?\n\nJORDAN\nI'm not kidding around.\n\nLeo looks at her for a few more moments, then slowly turns back toward the\ncommittee. He removes\nhis hand from the microphone and leans toward it to speak.\n\nLEO\nYes, I am.\n\nERICKSON\nIt says if something happens to the President then the Vice-President will\nassume his duties.\n\nLEO\nNo, it says the Vice President assumes his duties if the President dies. Short\nof that,\nimpeachment, or the 25th Amendment being invoked, the Vice President stays\nthe Vice President.\n\nERICKSON\nWho picked John Hoynes to be the running mate on the ticket?\n\nLEO\nThe President did.\n\nERICKSON\nDid he have any help?\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nERICKSON\nDo you think the people who weighed in on the decision might have benefited\nfrom knowing about\nthe President's health condition?\n\nLEO\nI don't see how. No.\n\nERICKSON\nWell, with the possibility that the President might die in office...\n\nLEO\nHold it.\n\nERICKSON\n...a greater possibility with this President...\n\nLEO\n[emphatically] No, sir. That isn't true. MS isn't fatal. And while on national\ntelevision, it is\ncriminal to imply otherwise in an effort to score some cheap points. [pause]\nYou owe an apology\nto fathers of children who are suffering from this disease.\n\nERICKSON\nMr. McGarry, I...\n\nLEO\nFinally, the President chose his running mate using the only yardstick that\nmeans anything:\nability to assume the duties of the Presidency. And with John Hoynes, we\ngot our man.\nAnd the Vice President was immediately told of the President's condition.\n\nFADE TO: INT. PRESIDENTIAL HOTEL SUITE AT THE CONVENTION - FLASHBACK\nThe suite is large, with several separate areas, including a seating area\nwith sofas.\nIn the entryway, a TV is broadcasting MSNBC news coverage from the convention\nfloor.\nThe sound of cheers and applause mingles with the news anchor's voice.\n\nNEWS ANCHOR [on TV]\nI can tell you that when Jed Bartlet takes this stage 72 hours from now,\nthese delegates are\ngonna go absolutely crazy.\n\nVarious aides - including Toby, Josh, Sam, and C.J. - are milling around by\nthe sofas along\nwith Bartlet and Leo. Abbey is getting coffee from a table near the TV. She\nsmiles at an aide\nand walks across the room.\n\nBARTLET\nToby?\n\nTOBY\n[walks toward Bartlet] Yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nSam?\n\nSAM\n[smiles] Yeah. I think so.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\n[turns to look at Leo] All right, let's do it.\n\nLEO\nAll right.\n\nLeo walks toward the door. Abbey catches her husband's eye as she moves to\nstand where Leo was\nstanding moments before. Bartlet is holding a mug of coffee, looking rather\ncalm. In contrast,\nAbbey appears a little tense - she's wringing her hands and looks somewhat\nworried - although\nshe's trying not to show it. Leo opens the door. John Hoynes is standing in\nthe hallway talking\nwith several aides.\n\nLEO\nJohn?\n\nHoynes looks over at Leo, then walks into the suite and shakes Leo's hand.\n\nHOYNES\nLeo.\n\nLeo quietly closes the door and watches as Hoynes greets Abbey, who has\nbanished the tension\nfrom her face. They embrace formally. He kisses her on the cheek.\n\nHOYNES\nHello, Abbey.\n\nABBEY\nHello, John.\n\nBARTLET\n[smiles] Senator.\n\nBartlet and Hoynes shake hands.\n\nHOYNES\nGood evening.\n\nBARTLET\nI'd like you to be the Vice-President.\n\nHoynes' expression goes from amiable smile to shock. He and Bartlet stare\nat each other\nsilently for a few moments.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy don't you sit with Abbey and me for a few minutes. [turns to aides]\nCan I have the\nroom, please?\n\nAs the staff quickly take their leave, Bartlet walks over to a table on the\nother side of\nthe suite. He pours himself another cup of coffee.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Hoynes] You want anything? Coffee or anything?\n\nHoynes, his hands in his pockets, walks slowly toward Bartlet.\n\nHOYNES\nAh... no.\n\nOn yet another TV, this one in a corner, crowds on the convention floor can\nbe heard chanting\n\"Bartlet! Bartlet!\" Hoynes glances over at the TV. Abbey finally joins them\nbut stands a bit\noff to one side. Again, she looks a bit nervous and distracted as she fidgets\nwith her wedding\nring and watches the two men talk.\n\nBARTLET\nYou ran a good campaign. [pause] You're a young man. You'll be back.\n\nHOYNES\n[nods] Thank you.\n\nBartlet finishes getting his coffee and walks back over to the sofas. Hoynes\nand Abbey join him\nas the last of the aides leaves and the door to the hall finally\ncloses. Bartlet and Hoynes sit\ndown across from each other. Abbey remains standing off to one side.\n\nBARTLET\nThere's something you need to know. It's why I asked everyone to leave the\nroom.\n[short pause] A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a relapsing remitting\ncourse of MS.\n\nHOYNES\n[confused] I'm sorry?\n\nBARTLET\nMultiple sclerosis.\n\nHoynes, stunned, glances over at Abbey with a vaguely accusatory expression\non his face. Bartlet\nlooks over at her, too. She meets Hoynes' gaze. She reveals very little,\nsays nothing, but her\nexpression is grave.\n\nHOYNES\n[to Bartlet] Did you just tell me that you have MS?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nHOYNES\nWhich you never mentioned during the campaign.\n\nBartlet shakes his head. Hoynes raises an eyebrow and sighs heavily.\n\nBARTLET\nI told you because it's something you're gonna need to know. But also because\nI wanted to show\nthat I trust you.\n\nHOYNES\n[slight edge to his voice] Oh, you do?\n\nBARTLET\n[unfazed] Yeah.\n\nHOYNES\n[leans forward] That's supposed to be me accepting the nomination Thursday\nnight. But I suppose\nyour trusting me is consolation prize enough.\n\nBARTLET\n[doesn't flinch, pauses] Well, what do you say?\n\nHoynes shrugs his shoulders, sighs, and stands up.\n\nHOYNES\nI'd like to think about it... for a few...\n\nBARTLET\n[stands] I'd like your answer now, John.\n\nThey stare at each other for several long moments, the tension rising.\n\nHOYNES\nYou'll have it when I give it, Jed.\n\nHoynes turns and leaves, almost slamming the door on his way out. Bartlet\nwatches him go.\nAbbey stares at her husband. She doesn't speak; she barely moves. Her\nexpression is a\nmixture of concern and disbelief. Bartlet stands very still, not meeting\nher gaze, his\nhands in his pockets. In contrast to their mutual silence, a TV mounted in\nthe wall behind\nBartlet is broadcasting boisterous images from the convention floor. Finally,\nBartlet\nreluctantly meets his wife's gaze - only for a moment - and then he walks\ntoward the door,\nlooking frustrated and perhaps a little upset, since his voice breaks slightly\nwhen he speaks.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm gonna stretch my legs.\n\nSlowly, Abbey turns to watch him leave. She fidgets with her wedding ring\nand lets the shock\nand worry wash over her face.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT.

LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nLeo is meeting with three men, two of whom are CEOs. CEO #1 is balding\nslightly; CEO #2 has a\nmoustache. They're all chuckling. Before they sit down, Leo shakes each of\ntheir hands, a big\nsmile plastered on his face.\n\nLEO [VO]\nIt was nine days 'til the election.

He assesses the space\nwith his eyes as he\nwalks toward the stage. C.J. smiles and shakes hands with a woman - probably\none of the debate\norganizers. They all follow Bartlet up to the stage, where there are two\npodiums and a table\nfor the moderators. Opposite the stage, there are hundreds of seats for the\naudience. Lots of\naides are bustling about, making preparations.\n\nLEO [VO]\nHe makes it his own like it's an extension of his body. You ever see a\npitcher work the mound so\nthe dirt does exactly what his feet want it to do? That's the President.

Bartenders are selling it\nfor thirty bucks a shot.\n\nHe uncorks the bottle and slowly pours the scotch into a glass on the table\nin front of him.\n\nLEO [VO]\nGood scotch sits in a charcoal barrel for 12 years. Very good scotch gets\nsmoked for 29 years.\n\nFADE TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT\n\nLEO\n[nostalgic] Johnny Walker Blue...is 60-year-old scotch.\n\nJORDAN\n[impatiently] I don't care.

Leo and the donors are chuckling jovially, but\nLeo's face reveals the\nstrain he's feeling as he watches the other men drink. His grin has taken\non a dark quality.\nA lull in the laughter and conversation leaves Leo staring at the glass of\nscotch in CEO 1's hand.\nHe looks around awkwardly for a moment, then tries to banish temptation by\nchanging the subject.\n\nLEO\nShould we get to it?\n\nThe THIRD MAN is visible, sitting in the background off to one side, but\nhis identity is hidden\namidst the ample cigar smoke.\n\nCEO 1\n[holding up his glass] You don't wanna find out what a thirty dollar sip of\nscotch tastes like?\n\nLeo stares at the glass. He's visibly struggling to control himself, so he\nresponds with a smile\nand tries to sound relaxed and nonchalant.\n\nLEO\n[nods] Naw... I gotta... stay sharp for tonight.\n\nCEO 1 sets his drink down and stands up.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT\n\nJORDAN\nWhy don't you just say, \"I'm an alcoholic?\"\n\nLEO\nThey're two CEOs.

DEBATE SITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nJosh and Sam are huddled by one podium, talking. C.J. and Toby are conferring\nby the other\npodium. Dozens of aides are still bustling around in the background. Bartlet\nis standing by\nthe moderators' table with the woman that C.J. greeted on the way into the\ntheater.\n\nWOMAN\nHow do you feel about the temperature, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nIt's good.\n\nWOMAN\nIt's not too cold?\n\nBARTLET\n[glancing around] It won't be later. This is a 550 seat theater and they'll\nbe seated a\nhalf-hour before we start, so the temperature'll be up four to six degrees.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT\n\nJORDAN\n[loudly, an edge to her voice] The hotel room, Leo.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nThe four men are still seated around the coffee table - the two CEOs across\nfrom Leo, the\nthird man still off to one side, sipping his drink. Dim light is filtering\nin through the\nwindows and French doors. The bottle and glasses are on the table. Leo is\nhunched over in\nhis seat, fidgeting.\n\nCEO 2\nWe already gave to the RNC but we're worried we may have backed the wrong\nhorse.\n\nLEO\nYou wanna hedge your bet.\n\nCEO 1\n[nods] That's why we're here.\n\nLEO\n[nods, tense] Good... Now gimme a sip of that.\n\nCEO 2 smiles and hands Leo his glass. The ice cubes rattle against the glass\nas Leo holds\nit and takes a quick sip. He tries to act like it's no big deal, but his\nexpression\nindicates otherwise.\n\nLEO\nThat's what I remember.\n\nCEO 1 chuckles.\n\nFADE TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT\n\nJORDAN\nYou had a drink.\n\nLEO\nI'm an alcoholic. I don't have one drink. [pauses] I don't understand people\nwho have one\ndrink. I don't understand people who leave half a glass of wine on the\ntable. I don't\nunderstand people who say they've had enough. How can you have enough of\nfeeling like this?\nHow can you not want to feel like this longer? [pauses, sighs] My brain\nworks differently.\n\nJORDAN\nWho was the third person in the room?\n\nLEO\nWell, now we've arrived at our problem.\n\nFADE TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nLeo is drinking scotch heartily and smoking as they talk.\n\nLEO\n[to CEOs] Count on it.\n\nTHIRD MAN\nWhoa, you want to be careful there.\n\nLeo glances over at him as he stands up.\n\nTHIRD MAN\nYou're not the big money party. We are.\n\nLeo chuckles silently and takes another sip of scotch.\n\nCEO 1\n[to Leo] Did I mention that he's thinking about running for Congress?\n\nThe third man sits down on the sofa next to Leo. It's Gibson. He smiles as\nLeo glances over\nat him again.\n\nGIBSON\nI'm thinking about it.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT\n\nJORDAN\nYou were drunk in front of Gibson?\n\nLEO\nI don't get drunk in front of people. I get drunk alone.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nThe CEOs and Gibson have left. Leo opens the wall cupboard containing the\nmini-bar. He pulls\nout several miniature bottles of booze and checks his watch. He's stonefaced,\nalmost like\nhe's on auto-pilot.\n\nLEO [VO]\nThey were going over something at the debate site...\n\nJORDAN [VO]\n[impatiently] I don't want to hear about the debate site.\n\nLEO [VO]\nThe debate site is what happened. The debate site is how he gets to bring\nthis up here.\n\nCUT TO: INT. DEBATE SITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nOn one side of the stage, Sam and Josh walk over to where C.J. and Toby have\nbeen talking.\nBartlet is standing by himself on the other side of the stage. The theater\nis still buzzing\nwith aides making preparations.\n\nSAM\n[to C.J.] Where's Leo?\n\nJOSH\n[to C.J. and Toby] I'd still like to go over the Social Security answer. We\ngotta get it\ndown to 90 seconds.\n\nC.J.\nIt's down to 90 seconds.\n\nBartlet wanders past a TV monitor on a cart. He's wearing a sweater over a\ndress shirt.\nHe puts his glasses in his shirt pocket. He looks slightly distracted,\nperhaps a bit\nunsteady. He's looking down at the floor and holding onto his coat.\n\nJOSH\nIt's not - and they're gonna cut him off.\n\nThe foursome slowly walk across the stage toward Bartlet, who's standing\nnext to the TV\nmonitor.\n\nSAM\nI put a stopwatch on him. When he just speeds up...\n\nJOSH\nWhen he speeds up, he speeds up. When he doesn't... It's 90 seconds. We need\nto cut some more.\n\nBartlet crosses his arms over his chest and hunches over slightly.\n\nTOBY\n[to Josh] Which words?\n\nJOSH\nGovernor, what do you think? Governor?\n\nBartlet appears increasingly unsteady on his feet, a bit dazed, maybe short\nof breath.\nBut it's subtle enough that his aides don't seem to notice.\n\nJOSH\nSir, we were just saying on the Social Security answer...\n\nBARTLET\n[softly] No.\n\nJOSH\n...it's a tight ninety seconds, and...\n\nBARTLET\n[looking at floor, swaying] No, no. Not now.\n\nJOSH\n[scoffs, looks around at the others] Well, we gotta do it now, sir.\n\nBartlet stares blankly, straight ahead, then suddenly reaches out his right\narm to balance\nhimself, leaning on the TV for support.\n\nTOBY\nSomething's wrong.\n\nC.J.\nGovernor?\n\nBARTLET\n[gasping softly, trying to keep his balance] Yeah.\n\nJOSH\nGovernor? [pause] Sir?\n\nBARTLET\nG'abbey...\n\nSAM\nYou wanna sit down?\n\nC.J.\nLet me get some water. [turns around to grab a bottle of water]\n\nBARTLET\nG'abbey...\n\nTOBY\nHe's saying, \"Get Abbey.\"\n\nJOSH\n[to an aide] Get Abbey!\n\nBartlet loses his balance and pitches sideways toward Sam, who catches him,\nwith assistance\nfrom Toby and Josh.\n\nJOSH\nWhoa...\n\nSam and Toby hold Bartlet up. A security agent rushes over to help.\n\nTOBY\n[looks up at C.J.] C.J.\n\nC.J. stares at Toby. She looks shocked, a bit unsure about what to do.\n\nJORDAN [VO]\nHe had an attack?\n\nLEO [VO]\nI mean, the doctor said it was an inner ear infection.\n\nToby and Sam help Bartlet regain his balance. They help him walk backstage,\nalong with the\nagent. Josh walks behind them, stops, and takes out his cell phone. He looks\nup at C.J.,\nconcern all over his face.\n\nLEO [VO]\nBut all Josh knew when he called me was that he'd collapsed. I was supposed\nto be down there\nalready. I was supposed to be down there an hour ago.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S HOTEL SUITE - ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI - FLASHBACK\nLeo is sitting on the sofa, pouring himself another drink. The coffee table\nis covered with\nempty bottles and glasses. The phone by the bed rings and rings. His breathing\nis labored\nand he's unsteady on his feet as he struggles to stand up and make his way\nover to the bed.\nHe takes a gulp of scotch, presses the speakerphone button, and sits down\non the bed.\nThen he leans back on the pillows and closes his eyes, the glass still in\nhis hand.\n\nLEO\n[loud] Yeah.\n\nJOSH\n[on phone] Leo, the Governor's sick.\n\nThe buzzer to Leo's suite sounds. He sits up slowly, awkwardly, as he\nregisters what Josh\nis saying and that the buzzer is sounding.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\n[on phone] He collapsed. You gotta get down here.\n\nThe buzzer sounds again. Leo doesn't respond quickly to Josh; he tries not\nto panic,\ntries to get his bearing.\n\nJOSH\n[on phone] Leo.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nLeo sits up, lets go of his glass. Knocking on the door.\n\nGIBSON\n[at the door] It's Gibson.\n\nLEO\n[loud] Okay!\n\nSuddenly, Leo processes the implications of Gibson being at his door. He\nrubs his forehead\nand sighs, exasperated and overwhelmed. He's breathing heavily again as he\nshakily stands up.\n\nLEO\nOkay... Okay...\n\nHe walks to the door, smoothes his hair, and tries to straighten his rumpled\nsuit.\nThen he opens the door.\n\nLEO\nHey.\n\nGibson walks right in. Leo stands by the open door, shifting uneasily.\n\nGIBSON\nI forgot my briefcase.\n\nGibson grabs his briefcase from the floor by the sofa. In the process,\nhe notices all the\nbottles and glasses on the coffee table. He turns to look at Leo, questioning.\n\nGIBSON\nYou havin' a party?\n\nLEO\n[barely able to meet Gibson's gaze] I uh... I-I gotta get to the uh debate\nsite. The Governor\ncollapsed.\n\nGibson nods slightly, then leaves and closes the door behind him. Before\nGibson is even out\nthe door, Leo looks confused, then pained, then horrified and filled with\nregret as he\nrealizes what he's done. He sighs and tries to catch his breath.\n\nFADE TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL WAITING ROOM - PRESENT\nLeo and Jordan are still sitting at the table, facing each other.\n\nJORDAN [VO]\nI don't understand how you could have a drink. I don't understand how,\nafter everything you\nworked for, how on that day of all days you could be so stupid.\n\nLEO\nThat's because you think it has something to do with smart and stupid. Do\nyou have any idea\nhow many alcoholics are in Mensa? You think it's a lack of willpower? That's\nlike thinking\nsomebody with anorexia nervosa has an overdeveloped sense of vanity. My\nfather was an\nalcoholic. [leans forward] His father was an alcoholic. So, in my case...\n\nJORDAN\n[nods] Ain't nothin' but a family thing.\n\nLEO\nThat's right.\n\nJORDAN\nWho knows?\n\nLEO\nJosh Lyman and the President.\n\nJORDAN\nWhy nobody else?\n\nLEO\nBecause.\n\nJORDAN\nThat's a little boy's answer.\n\nLEO\n[pauses] I went to rehab. My friends embraced me when I got out. You relapse,\nit's not\nlike that. \"Get away from me\" - that's what it's like.\n\nThere's a knock on the door and it opens. A security guard appears. Jordan\nturns to look\nat him.\n\nGUARD\nWe're back in a minute.\n\nJORDAN\nThank you.\n\nThe guard closes the door. Jordan turns back toward Leo.\n\nJORDAN\nJust out of curiosity... Why have you been asking me to have a meal with\nyou every five\nminutes?\n\nLEO\nI like you. I've been tryin' to get it in under the wire.\n\nJordan takes a moment to take this in. She seems a bit surprised.\n\nJORDAN\nYou'll answer the questions - simply and directly. I don't want to hear\nabout Mensa.\nThat'll be my job.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nLeo stands up, walks toward the door. Jordan doesn't move, a hint of a smile\non her face.\nLeo opens the door as Jordan stands up and walks toward him.\n\nJORDAN\nYes, by the way.\n\nLEO\nYes? What?\n\nJORDAN\nYes, I'd like to have dinner with you tonight.\n\nLEO\n[surprised] Okay.\n\nJordan walks out ahead of him and he follows her.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY\nPeople are milling around, waiting for the hearing to reconvene. There's a\nsmall room off\nthe hallway. A guard is standing beside the glass door. Inside the room,\nBruno, Cliff,\nand Gibson are standing face to face arguing.\n\nCLIFF\nThat's where you're going with this?\n\nGIBSON\nYeah.\n\nCLIFF\nJust to embarrass the guy?\n\nGIBSON\nJust?\n\nCLIFF\nLeo McGarry's sobriety isn't the subject of these hearings. These hearings\nare to investigate...\n\nCUT TO: INT. A SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nCLIFF\n...if any rules - ethical or otherwise - were broken by Jed Bartlet while\nhe was running\nfor President.\n\nGIBSON\nThat's nice, but I live in the actual world where the object of these hearings\nis to win.\n\nCLIFF\n[shakes his head] No... it's not.\n\nBruno listens closely, stonefaced.\n\nGIBSON\nIt's the object of the Majority.\n\nCLIFF\nNot while I'm the Majority Counsel, it's not. This is bush league. This is\nwhy good people\nhate us. This right here. This thing. [Bruno turns his back on them and\nleans on a table.]\nThis isn't what these hearings are about. [Gibson glances over at Bruno,\npeeved.] He cannot\npossibly have been properly prepared by counsel for these questions, nor\nshould he ever\nhave to answer them publicly.\n\nBruno turns back around, rubbing his chin, looking concerned.\n\nCLIFF\n[jabbing his finger at Gibson] And if you proceed with this line of\nquestioning, I will\nresign this committee and wait in the tall grass for you, Congressman,\nbecause you are\nkilling the party.\n\nCliff glares at Gibson, who turns toward Bruno.\n\nGIBSON\nWho the hell is this?\n\nBruno meets his gaze.\n\nCLIFF\n[to Bruno] You don't have to make up your mind right now, Mr. Chairman...\n\nGIBSON\nPhil...\n\nCLIFF\nYou don't have to make up your mind right now. Declare a recess 'til after\nthe holidays.\nBuy yourself two weeks.\n\nGIBSON\n[to Cliff] And give him two weeks to circle the wagons?\n\nCliff maintains eye contact with Bruno, although he'd clearly love to respond\nto Gibson.\n\nGIBSON\n[to Bruno] How do you think the Speaker's gonna feel about this? To say\nnothing of the RNC?\n\nBRUNO\n[sighs] I need a minute.\n\nGibson quickly leaves, followed by Cliff, who practically slams the door on\nhis way out.\nHe walks through the crowd of people in the hallway, back toward the hearing\nroom.\nLeo is in the hallway, shaking someone's hand, and notices Cliff walk by.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY\nA TV in the hallway is showing coverage of the hearing. Phones are ringing\nand staff members\nare bustling about. Sam walks through a swinging door and heads toward Josh's\noffice.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nJosh is leaning against the back of a chair, watching the hearing on his TV,\nand rubbing\nhis forehead. Sam appears in the doorway.\n\nSAM\nI tried everybody.\n\nJOSH\n[looks up] It's all right.\n\nSAM\nI tried everybody. It was just a tough fit. And since I couldn't tell 'em\nwhat it was about...\n\nJOSH\n[points at the TV] They're back.\n\nSam sighs heavily. They both focus their attention on the TV.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY\nBruno gavels the hearing back into session.\n\nBRUNO\nLet's come to order.\n\nJordan and Leo are back in their seats. Jordan looks a little worried.\n\nBRUNO\nMr. Gibson, you can proceed with your questioning.\n\nCliff sighs with exasperation. Leo stares at Gibson.\n\nGIBSON\nMr. McGarry, 30 October in St. Louis, Missouri, the date Jed Bartlet was...\n\nBRUNO\n[holds up a hand in Gibson's direction] No, I'm sorry. [pause] Mr. McGarry,\nit's been a\nlong day and, unless Counsel has an objection, I'm gonna resume this after\nthe holidays.\n\nJordan and Leo are stunned.\n\nLEO\nWhat?\n\nCliff breathes a sigh of relief. Some members of the committee look pleasantly\nsurprised,\nothers not so much. Gibson shoots a warning glare at Bruno.\n\nGIBSON\nMr. Chairman...\n\nBRUNO\nMr. Calley.\n\nCLIFF\nMr. McGarry, that concludes our questioning for today...\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nCLIFF\n[on TV] We'll pick it up here when the Chairman gavels these hearings back\nto order.\n\nJosh sighs with relief.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOM - DAY\nLeo is still confused and not sure if this is real.\n\nLEO\nI'm sorry...?\n\nBRUNO\nYou're done for the day, sir. The House Reform and Government Oversight\nCommittee stands\nin recess until January the 5th, and the Chair wishes everyone a Merry\nChristmas.\n\nThe hum of conversation fills the room as people begin to stand up. Several\npeople in the\naudience - journalists, presumably - leap out of their seats to go\noutside. Jordan is\npleased, but very surprised. Leo still can't believe it. They steal short\nglances at each\nother. Jordan chuckles softly to herself.\n\nLEO\nWhat the hell...?\n\nJORDAN\n[shakes her head] I don't know. [They both stand up.] We have two weeks.\n\nA woman who's been sitting behind Jordan hands her a coat. Leo leans against\nhis chair.\n\nLEO\nI really had to tell you the damn story?\n\nJORDAN\nShut up. I'm going to dinner with you.\n\nShe starts to leave, passing Margaret, who's standing behind Leo.\n\nLEO\n[softly] Yeah. [pauses, turns to look at her] Well, listen.\n\nJORDAN\nWhat?\n\nLEO\nYou wanna do it tomorrow night instead?\n\nJORDAN\nWhat's tomorrow night?\n\nLEO\nIt's Christmas Eve.\n\nJORDAN\n[pauses, smiles, nods] Okay.\n\nLEO\n[smiles] Okay.\n\nJordan walks off into the crowd. Leo gathers his things from the table and\nglances up at the\ncommittee dais. Cliff is standing behind his chair, also gathering his\nthings. They meet each\nother's gaze for several long moments. Cliff looks away first, then quickly\nleaves. Leo seems\nto realize what - or who - may have stopped the hearing. Then he turns around\ntoward Margaret,\nwho's been chatting amiably with someone. Slowly, they walk out of the\nhearing room together.\n\nFADE TO: EXT. WHITE HOUSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT\nLater that evening, a guard opens one of the French doors for Leo. The door\ncloses slowly\nbehind him.\n\nFADE TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS\nLeo walks purposefully through the corridors, which are decorated with\nholiday lights.\nEveryone has gone for the day. Leo finally reaches his office, but he doesn't\nnotice\nBartlet - sitting in a corner chair, his feet propped up on another chair,\npatiently\nwaiting for his friend. The office is dark; only a few lamps and a TV are\nstill on.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nLeo walks over to his desk to grab his phone messages, his back to Bartlet.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, well, well.\n\nLeo turns around, only slightly surprised to see him.\n\nBARTLET\nDodged a bullet.\n\nLEO\nFor the moment.\n\nBARTLET\n[genially] Which is more than I can say for me in Rosslyn.\n\nLEO\n[nods, smiles] Yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you get a date with her?\n\nLEO\nIt's none of your business... [walks around behind his desk] I just came\nback to catch\nup on some work. [joking] See how badly you screwed up this church thing in\nTennessee.\n\nBARTLET\nI did the church thing in Tennessee okay. I did it without you.\n\nLEO\nYou mind if I make some calls - see if Tennessee's still one of the states\nand stuff?\n\nBartlet smiles, stands, and picks up a small package with a big red bow from\nthe table\nbeside him.\n\nBARTLET\nSo anyway, I have a present for you.\n\nBartlet walks over to Leo's desk. Leo is surprised and acts like Bartlet\nreally didn't\nhave to get him anything - although he's clearly pleased. Bartlet hands him\nthe gift.\n\nBARTLET\nMerry Christmas, Leo.\n\nLeo removes the bow, revealing a small square black frame holding the\n\"BARTLET FOR AMERICA\"\nnapkin from their first meeting in New Hampshire. It's wrinkled but it's\nstill legible.\nLeo stares at it for several moments, then slowly looks up at Bartlet. Clearly,\nhe's very\nmoved.\n\nBARTLET\nThat was awfully nice of you.\n\nLeo looks down at the frame again and starts to lose control over his\nemotions. Bartlet\nsenses this and leaves, walking through the passage to the Oval Office. Once\nBartlet is\ngone, Leo shifts back and forth on his feet and holds the frame to his\nchest. When he\ncan't stay standing any longer, he sits down heavily in his chair. And then\nhe allows\nhimself a good cry.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

Well... I'll just call the President and suggest to him that he allow\na huge\nbipartisan vote on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives calling\nhim a liar,\nand that he welcome the result.

What was about to happen?\n\nCLIFF\nI can't tell you that.\n\nDONNA\nIt was you.\n\nCLIFF\nI need to talk to Josh.\n\nDONNA\nI'm leaving now. Wait by your phone.\n\nINT.

Thank you for the extra olive.\n\nWAITRESS\nSure.\n\nAMY\n\"Sure.\" That's your type, isn't it?\n\nJOSH\nWon't catch her at the ballet.\n\nAMY\nOr in a library either.\n\nJOSH\nShe seemed smart to me.\n\nAMY\nWhat do you want?\n\nJOSH\nHow can you be blase about this?\n\nAMY\nAbout what?\n\nJOSH\nThe United States is one of only six other countries out of 152 that has no\nnational\npolicy regarding paid maternal leave.\n\nAMY\nNeither does Papua New Guinea, so we're fine.\n\nJOSH\nReally?\n\nAMY\nWhat are you talking to me for? Get it for us.\n\nJOSH\nCan't do it.\n\nAMY\nI know.\n\nJOSH\nBut money has been put aside for a study.\n\nAMY\nAnd that's great.\n\nJOSH\nThe thing is...and here's the bad news.\n\nAMY\nYeah?\n\nJOSH\nYou guys wanted $21 million?\n\nAMY\nYeah?\n\nJOSH\nIt's going to be $20 million 500,000. You want to take my head off, go ahead.\n\nAMY\nWhat the hell's going on?\n\nJOSH\nThings are tight all over.\n\nAMY\nIs it possible that you are so addled that you've constructed some nonsense\nproblem so\nthat you'd have an excuse to see me?\n\nJOSH\nI mean, i-is it possible? I suppose you can say...\n\nAMY\nI don't believe you.\n\nJOSH\nHey, you threw a water balloon at me.\n\nAMY\nAnd?\n\nJOSH\nI don't know, I was just throwing that out there.\n\nAMY\nLook...\n\nJOSH\nLike there's not a reason you're here right now?\n\nAMY\nI'm here because I thought there was a problem.\n\nJOSH\nAll I know is you're here, I'm here and Nijinsky's home watching Leno.\n\nAMY\nOh, by all means, make fun of my boyfriend seeing as how you've never met\nhim.\n\nJOSH\nYour boyfriend?\n\nAMY\nWhy can't you pick up a phone and say, \"Would you like to go out\nsometime?\" Why?\nLook... I'll tell you why.\n\nJOSH\nDo you need me in this conversation or are you okay by yourself?\n\nAMY\nBecause this is what you like, this. Not anything else. This is the fun part.\n\nJOSH\nThat's not true.\n\nAMY\nYes, it is. We're not in the dorm anymore. I get paid a lot of money to do\nan important\njob and I'm not into getting diddled around by guys like you.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, that's like the fifth time you've said \"guys like you.\"\n\nAMY\nIt is not.\n\nJOSH\nIt's the second time.\n\nAMY\nFine.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's with guys like me?\n\nAMY\nIf this thing went five minutes longer than you wanted it to go you'd run\nfor the hills.\nYou're \"Hit-and-Run Josh.\"\n\nJOSH\nThat's not true. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello. Donna, I'm kind of in\nthe middle of\nsomething. What were you doing talking to...? Okay, tell him yeah. I have\nto go.\n\nAMY\nYes, indeed.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry. I-I can't explain. [clears throat] I have to go.\n\nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President? Can you see Sam?\n\nBARTLET\nSure.\n\nSAM\nGood evening, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nEverybody's working late.\n\nSAM\nI live here in January.\n\nBARTLET\nHow's it going?\n\nSAM\nIt's going well, I think. But I don't know. Who knows at this point?\n\nBARTLET\nThe early drafts look good.\n\nSAM\nThank you, but, actually, I didn't come in to talk about the State of the\nUnion.\nThere's going to be a book coming out in about three weeks.\n\nBARTLET\nI heard. Look, I'm really not going to talk to you about my underwear.\n\nSAM\nThat's... disappointing, Mr. President. But I wanted to ask you... the guy\nclaims\nthat while you don't poll on matters of foreign policy that at the first\nformal\nmeeting of the Joint Chiefs you upbraided them for bloated Pentagon spending\nand\ntold them 73% of the public was with you on it. I don't remember any such\npoll being\ndone, do you?\n\nBARTLET\nNo, but I guess that doesn't mean it wasn't.\n\nSAM\nDo you remember saying that at the first meeting with the Joint Chiefs?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't.\n\nSAM\nCould you have said anything like it?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't even remember the meeting.\n\nSAM\nOkay. Thank you, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy does it matter?\n\nSAM\nExcuse me?\n\nBARTLET\nI said, \"Why does it matter?\"\n\nSAM\nWell, 'cause I don't think it's such a good idea to be casual about the\ntruth.\n\nBARTLET\nNeither do I.\n\nSAM\nThank you, sir.\n\nINT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT\n\nJOSH\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWhat are you doing down here?\n\nLEO\nChange of scenery. What are you doing?\n\nJOSH\nWell, I'd like to talk to you about the deal they're offering.\n\nLEO\nPlease, keep your voice down.\n\nJOSH\nThere's nobody here, and my voice is down.\n\nLEO\nWho have you been talking to?\n\nJOSH\nCliff Calley.\n\nLEO\nHow did you get hooked up with Calley?\n\nJOSH\nDoesn't matter.\n\nLEO\nIt does matter.\n\nJOSH\nI'm not pushing you, okay? I just want to hear your reasons.\n\nLEO\nWhat are your reasons?\n\nJOSH\nGets it over and done instead of dragging it through the primary\nseason. Moreover,\nyou don't take the stand on Monday.\n\nLEO\nIt's ridiculous to think that this would end it. All it means is that we go\ndown in\nhistory.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a press release.\n\nLEO\nWhen the British Ambassador told the German Foreign Minister that they were\ngoing to\nwar over Belgium's violation of the neutrality treaty the German Foreign\nMinister\nsaid \"You're going to war over a piece of paper?\"\n\nJOSH\nLeo...\n\nLEO\nIt is an historical judgment. Andrew Jackson knew that.\n\nJOSH\nJackson was censured?\n\nLEO\nOver the Bank of the U.S.\n\nJOSH\nGuess what. I didn't know that.\n\nLEO\nWhat's your point?\n\nJOSH\nHistory forgets these things.\n\nLEO\nPresidents don't. They never get over it. This one won't. He'd act like it's\nfine,\nbut...he'd never get over it. So... that's my reason.\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nLEO\nYou're going home?\n\nJOSH\nYeah. Sure.\n\nLEO\nHave a good night.\n\nJOSH\nYou, too.\n\nINT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nTOBY\nMcDeere shot 1 for 23 from the field last night. Missed his first 18\nattempts. Wouldn't\nyou think after the first 17 misses the coach would say, \"Mickey, this isn't\nyour night\"?\n\nC.J.\nYou don't have work to do?\n\nTOBY\nI have a lot of work to do.\n\nC.J.\nAnd?\n\nTOBY\nCan't rush these things.\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nTOBY\n1 for 23. That's exactly one better than my mother would have done. She's\nbeen dead\n12 years.\n\nSAM\n[knocking] Excuse me.\n\nC.J.\nHi.\n\nSAM\nI asked the President about that first meeting.\n\nTOBY\nWhich meeting?\n\nSAM\nWith the Joint Chiefs.\n\nTOBY\nWhat'd he say?\n\nSAM\nHe didn't remember whether or not we did a poll.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, I don't either.\n\nSAM\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nHow long ago was it?\n\nSAM\nIt was... I don't know. It was, like... I don't know. It was two years ago.\n\nTOBY\nHow many polls ago?\n\nSAM\nWe can't sit on... I'm sorry. We can't sit on the sidelines and ignore this\ncrap.\nI'm not going to. Why am I the only one taking this seriously?\n\nTOBY\nThat's a reasonable question and we should explore that for a minute.\n\nSAM\nIt's not the reason you think.\n\nTOBY\nYou hired the guy.\n\nSAM\nYes, I hired the guy, but that's not... Legitimate news organizations are\ngoing to cover\nthis to say nothing of the people who hate us who are going to run it over,\nover, over,\nover, over...This guy was here for three minutes and he was fired. He is\nnot credible.\nI'm a lawyer, I'm telling you. That has to be made clear. Every time he\nmakes a factual\nmistake we got to come out with a press release. Every time he misquotes or\nmisidentifies\nanyone we need to have an affidavit swearing to the truth. If there's a\ncomma in the\nwrong place he needs to be killed until he is dead and he needs to be killed\nagain or\nhe is going to keep biting at our ankles and I mean all through the\ncampaign. He needs\nto be a joke, or we're going to be.\n\nC.J.\n[snapping fingers rhythmically] Boy, boy, crazy boy. Keep cool, boy...\n\nSAM\nI'm not screwing around.\n\nC.J.\nMe neither. Sit down.\n\nSAM\nI'm not going to be a victim of this.\n\nC.J.\nLet me tell you something I've learned in my years. There are victims of\nfires. There\nare victims of car accidents. This kind of thing, there are no victims--just\nvolunteers.\nOf course we'll get in the game. I'll talk to the editors of the major papers\nbut we're\nnot going to publicly refute every bogus charge. First of all, there are\ntoo many of them.\nSecond of all, I'm not going to give this guy and his book the weight of\nthe White House.\nAs far as the press is concerned I've read the book because I had to. You\nhave a vague\nrecollection of the guy but he wasn't here long enough to make a lasting\nimpression.\nHave you read the book? Of course not. You're too busy doing a job.\n\nSAM\nWhile you're convincing the Post and the Times that it's ridiculous...\n\nC.J.\nSam! Once again, we don't know what's going on in the Oval Office. Obviously,\nthere's\na problem. When it's our turn to worry about it they won't be shy about\ntelling us.\nLet's not fixate on the nuckleheaded stuff we think we can fix in the\nmeantime. And\nit feels a lot like...that's what you're doing.\n\nSAM\nAre you inside?\n\nTOBY\nJosh is. But let me ask you this. A guy shoots 1 for 23 from the field.\n\nSAM\nMcDeere?\n\nTOBY\nYeah. But he goes 8 for 8 from the foul line. My question is, why are you\nfouling this\nguy at all? I'd just get out of the way and point him toward the basket.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nSo we're done talking about this now.\n\nSAM\nIs there any beer?\n\nC.J.\nYou two have offices.\n\nTOBY\nIt's out in the refrigerator.\n\nSAM\nHey.\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nIt started snowing.\n\nEXT. JOSH'S FRONT STOOP, NIGHT\n\nAMY\nYou owe me a half a million dollars and a drink.\n\nJOSH\nI paid for the drinks.\n\nAMY\nAll right, then 500 grand.\n\nJOSH\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nAMY\nI'm just hanging out. Why? Do you live here?\n\nJOSH\nI do. I'm sorry I had to leave quickly before. I still can't tell you why.\n\nAMY\nWas it a matter of national security?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nAMY\nWould you tell me if it was a matter of national security?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nAMY\nOkay. You didn't talk to me much at school.\n\nJOSH\nYou were having quite a bit of sex with Chris.\n\nAMY\nThere were times I wasn't.\n\nJOSH\nI studied a lot in school. I studied hard in high school and at Harvard and\nin law\nschool. My IQ doesn't break the bank, and I wanted to do this so I studied\nall the\ntime. And I missed something or it's like I skipped a year 'cause I never\nlearned\nwhat you do after you think you like somebody-- what you do next. And\nevery-everybody\ndid learn. A lot of other people, anyway. I didn't walk out tonight. When\nmy phone\nrings at 11:00, it's important. Not important to me. Important. And I'm not\npuffing\nmyself so-so that you're...\n\nAMY\nYou know what? Maybe not so much for you with the talking. [they kiss]\nThanks for\nthe drink.\n\nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nBARTLET\nExcuse me.\n\nLEO\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYou want to step in for a second?\n\nLEO\nAre you up reading?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. No. A little bit. Mostly, I've been talking with Babish and some of\nthe deputies.\nThe Chairman, Trent, the Speaker, the Minority Leader.\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I'm going to do it.\n\nLEO\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nIt doesn't get Abbey off the hook. She's still going to have to deal with\nthe AMA.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nIt doesn't clear us up for the campaign. It's just a different looking stage\nweight\naround our ankle and now it comes with the Congressional Seal. It doesn't\ngive us any\nroom to argue the point. We've got two, maybe as many as three dozen House\nDemocrats\nin tight races, and you've still got MS. Doing this to save me the\nembarrassment I've\ngot coming to me is about the dumbest reason I can think...\n\nBARTLET\nThere's another reason.\n\nLEO\nWhat?\n\nBARTLET\nI was wrong. I was. I was just...I was wrong. Come on, you know that. Lots\nof times we\ndon't know what right or wrong is but lots of times we do and come on,\nthis is one.\nI may not have had sinister intent at the outset but there were plenty of\nopportunities\nfor me to make it right. No one in government takes responsibility for\nanything anymore.\nWe foster, we obfuscate, we rationalize. \"Everybody does it.\" That's what\nwe say. So we\ncome to occupy a moral safe house where everyone's to blame so no one's\nguilty. I'm to\nblame. I was wrong.\n\nLEO\nYou're ready for a Joint Resolution.\n\nBARTLET\nAs a matter of fact, it's not a Joint Resolution. The President still has\nto sign a\nJoint Resolution so, technically, it's a Concurrent Resolution. House\nConcurrent\nResolution 172. The lawyers will haggle over the wording in the next few\ndays. So,\nat least I'll make history, huh?\n\nLEO\nNo. I thought so, too, until I was talking to Josh. Andrew Jackson, 1834.\n\nBARTLET\nHe was censured in '34. He got it expunged in '36.\n\nLEO\nGood point. It's not that cold out.\n\nBARTLET\nNo. Let me ask you something. You may be the last sane voice around here.\n\nLEO\nHang on, before I forget. That map that Charlie gave you. Make sure you\ndon't put it\nwhere people can see it.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't believe this.\n\nLEO\nRecognizing Israel's a pretty hot button, wouldn't you say?\n\nBARTLET\nIn Lebanon. Not here. It's not like I'm thinking \"God, I was going to\nrecognize Israel,\nbut now that I've seen this map...\" You know what? Let's just sit here\nquietly.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE [O.S.]\nWould the Secretary read House Concurrent Resolution 172?\n\nHOUSE SECRETARY [O.S.]\n\"Whereas, in his conduct of the Office of the President of the United States\nJosiah\nBartlet has engaged in a course of deceitful and dishonest conduct designed\nto impede\nand deny the disclosure of vital matters of public concern, the United States\nCongress\nhereby condemns him for acting in a manner contrary to his trust as President\nto the\ngreat prejudice of the cause of justice and to the manifest injury of the\nAmerican people.\"\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

NATIONAL STRATEGIES GROUP - NIGHT\nIt's the night of the State of the Union address. The people -- staffers,\naides, and\npollsters -- are busier than usual. The place -- a bright and spacious room\nin the\nNational Strategies Group -- is filled with television screens, all of which\nare showing\none thing: President Jed Bartlet, as he delivers to Congress information on\nthe State of\nthe Union. In the bottom of every television screen is some kind of a dial\nor gauge,\nwhose purpose we don't know yet. A woman we'll know later as LISA SHERBORNE\nis looking\nat the largest screen, mounted from the ceiling in the middle of the room. She\nis Sam's\nex-fiancee, a shorthaired, blonde reporter. Sam joins her, and points to\nthe monitor as\nhe explains the dials.\n\nSAM\nThe dials go from zero to 100. They dial up if they like what he's saying. They\ndial down\nif they don't. All the numbers lead to a central computer.\n\nLISA\nLike the Nielsens.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nLISA\nThey're behind a screen somewhere.\n\nSAM\nHuh?\n\nLISA\nThe people with the dials. They're behind a screen somewhere.\n\nSam points to the other monitors by the wall. In close distance is a\nPHOTOGRAPHER, taking\nquite a lot of pictures.\n\nSAM\nThey're in Macomb County. They're in Portland. In Los Feliz,\nCalifornia. Norman, Oklahoma.\nJoey puts together a decent snapshot.\n\nLISA\nWhich one's Joey?\n\nSam looks over to a corner, where Joey and Kenny are busy looking at computer\nscreens.\n\nSAM\nKenny! Can we get Joey a second?\n\nKenny taps Joey and signs something to her. She turns and looks at Sam. She\nis sporting\na new haircut and new professional-looking glasses.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\n...And we will leave a safer, cleaner planet for future generations...\n\nJoey gestures at Sam to wait a minute. Sam signs something back.\n\nLISA\nWhen did you pick that up?\n\nSAM\nI just said thanks.\n\nFrom behind Lisa, the photographer takes two quick snapshots of Sam.\n\nSAM\nCould he go easy with the pictures?\n\nLISA\nYou said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nSAM\nWhen did I say that?\n\nLISA\nC.J. Cregg said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\n...this time, but I have the utmost confidence...\n\nJoey and Kenny finally approach them.\n\nSAM\nJoey, this is Lisa Sherborne. She's doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\n...whether it be two years or 22...\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI don't have a lot of time right now.\n\nLISA\nWhat do the different lines mean?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nRed's for Republicans, blue's for Democrats, and green's for Independents. When\nwe say\nsomething liberal, like...\n\nSAM\n\"Death is bad.\"\n\nJOEY\nRight.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\n...that is under protective...\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nBlues go up and reds go down. When we talk about values, reds and greens go\nup. You're\nusually lucky to break 65. I got to get back now.\n\nOur POINT OF VIEW shifts from Joey and Kenny as they walk off, to the large\nmonitor above\nthem. Now we can see the dials in great detail. Some numbers indicate the\ntime elapsed\nand the number of people in the audience. As Bartlet speaks, the three\ncolored lines move\nat constant speed with little or no fluctuation from the middle 50 line.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\nI have abiding respect for the Speaker of the House and the Majority\nLeader. They are men\nof fundamental decency and public servants of purpose.\n\nAPPLAUSE.\n\nLISA\nHow much of this did you write?\n\nSAM\nWe don't really talk about that.\n\nLISA\nYou think there's anything you're gonna talk about, or is this gonna be an\nextraction?\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\n...to the men and women of both chambers, who have labored to shed the weight\nof\npartisanship and donned the cloak of progress.\n\nAPPLAUSE.\n\nLISAThe lines don't seem to be doing much.\n\nSAM\n[raises index finger] Hang on.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\nIt may be said that in the last half century, America won the Cold War and\nmodeled\nfreedom for a waiting world. Today, we are faced with a new challenge...\n\nLISA\nBreaking out the greatest hits, huh?\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\n...Now in a new century, when we meet and master new forms of aggression\nand hatred,\nignorance and evil, our vigilance in the face of oppression and global terror\nwill be\nunequaled by any moment of human history.\n\nAPPLAUSE. Suddenly, all three lines in the dials make big jumps. They will\nstay above\n50 for a while.\n\nLISA\nNow you're cooking.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\nAnd to the enemies of freedom, the enemies of democracy, the enemies of\nAmerica, the\nenemies of humanity itself, we say here tonight with one voice. There is no\ncorner of\nthis earth so remote, no cave so dark, that you will not be found and brought\nto light\nand ended. More APPLAUSE. A majority of the audience gives Bartlet a standing\novation.\nSam dons a proud look. The lines are way above 50 now, indicating high 60s\nand 70s.\n\nLISA\nThat's a number spike.\n\nSAM\n[to a man in controls] Hey, crank that up.\n\nLISA\nYou broke 65 in all the lines.\n\nEven more APPLAUSE. Sam and Lisa walk to take a closer look at another screen.\n\nSAM\nWe nearly had one almost as big.\n\nLISA\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nI said we nearly had one almost as big.\n\nLISA\nWhat was it?\n\nSAM\nWe almost cured cancer.\n\nLISA\nReally?\n\nSAM\nThis close.\n\nLISA\nWhat happened?\n\nSAM\nJust one of those things.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\nA large number of staffers, aides, and guests are gathered and conversing\nin the well-lit\nand well-decorated Northwest Lobby. Soft music plays somewhere. From a table\non one side\na BARTENDER is serving drinks. Amy passes by and stops by the table.\n\nBARTENDER\nCan I help you, ma'am?\n\nAMY\nGlass of chardonnay, please.\n\nAmy waits for her drink.

After a moment, he orders his own drink.\n\nJOSH\nIce and vodka, please.\n\nA man announces an arrival. It's Sam, with Lisa and the photographer behind\nhim.\n\nMAN\nSam Seaborn!\n\nThe party guests acknowledge the announcement and applaud the great writer.\n\nSAM\nThank you. Thank you. I am at Ha Ha's in Cleveland on the 16th, and tip your\nwaitresses.\n\nSam shakes someone's hand, just as Josh approaches.\n\nJOSH\nSam. Congratulations.\n\nSAM\nHey, you too.\n\nThey hug tight.\n\nJOSH\nSo far so good, huh?\n\nSAM\nThe dials were what we thought. We'll wait for the overnights.\n\nJOSH\nLisa.\n\nLISA\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nStill trying to get waived into Generation X?\n\nLISA\nStill a pompous jackass?\n\nJOSH\nOh, you betcha. See you later.\n\nJosh walks away. Sam and Lisa head for the drinks table.\n\nMAN\nCongratulations, Sam.\n\nLISA\nTell me about the cancer thing.\n\nSAM\nIt got cut. [to the bartender] Jack Daniels.\n\nLISA\nYou were gonna cure cancer.\n\nSAM\nWe were gonna say we were gonna cure cancer. Curing it is someone else's\ndepartment.\n\nLISA\nHow does that work?\n\nSAM\nHow does what work?\n\nLISA\nDeciding what you're gonna say.\n\nSAM\nYou mean writing the State of the Union?\n\nLISA\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nIt's a long story.\n\nLISA\nI'm writing along story.\n\nSAM\nDo you do any kind of preparation before you come to report...\n\nLISA\nI prefer to...\n\nSAM\nHang out at Moomba?\n\nLisa gives Sam a convincing look.\n\nSAM\nThe process begins six weeks beforehand with budget meetings.\n\nLISA\nWhy budget meetings?\n\nSAM\n'Cause if we're introducing a new idea, people are gonna want to know how\nwe pay for it.\n\nSam continues, but we are introduced to a series of scenes explaining the\nwriting process\nof the State of the Union. The first of these show Ginger reading something\non her desk.\nA man with a cart passes by and places a stack of bound papers on Ginger's\ndesk.\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nMemos are written--\n\nGinger takes the memos, goes into SAM'S OFFICE where Toby, Sam, and\nother staffers are having a discussion. She puts the stack of memos on top\nof other\nstacks of papers on Sam's desk.\n\nSAM [V.O.]\n--they come from everywhere. Every agency, department, senior advisor,\noutside notable.\n\nLISA [V.O.]\nWhat's an outside notable?\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nFormer presidents, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates, Jesse Jackson, Mr. Rogers\nwants to write\nus a memo; we'll read it. We'll pass some of them on to the President. He'll\nstart making\nnotes in the margins.\n\nBartlet, in his BEDROOM, is up at a late hour reading and writing.\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nThen we have \"The President's First Thoughts\" meeting. That's when we all\nwant to kill\nourselves.\n\nLISA [V.O.]\nWhy?\n\nA staff meeting in the OVAL OFFICE shows Bartlet pacing.\n\nSAM [V.O.]\n'Cause that's when the President tells us we're nowhere.\n\nLISA [V.O.]\nWhy?\n\nSAM [V.O.]\n'Cause we're nowhere. So we try to figure out what people want to hear.\n\nAnother meeting, but this time with Joey in the MURAL ROOM with an appropriate\nvisual aid\nthat says \"1. Strong Leader 2. Values 3. Cares about us.\"\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nAnd that's when anybody who didn't want to kill themselves before has\ncertainly been\nconverted to the cult.\n\nLISA [V.O.]\nWhy is this so hard?\n\nSAM [V.O.]\n'Cause it's a white piece of paper.\n\nLISA [V.O.]\nHow high are the stakes?\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nHow high can you count?\n\nA woman in TOBY'S OFFICE puts three books on Toby's desk.\n\nLISA [V.O.]\nSo what do you do?\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nWhatever it takes to get started.\n\nYet another meeting, this time in the ROOSEVELT ROOM and with a big white\nboard, which\nbarely has any space to write on because of all the scribbles on it. Toby\nwalks to the\nboard and starts to write something.\n\nSAM [V.O.]\nAnd we read new memos, and we try new themes, and we hear new slogans,\nand we test new\nlines, and after a few weeks of that...\n\nToby reveals what he wrote on the board. In big black letters, it says,\n\"We're nowhere.\"\n\nSAM [V.O.]\n...we've still got a white piece of paper.\n\nBack in the WHITE HOUSE LOBBY, Sam and Lisa are now serving themselves with\nfood.\n\nLISA\nSo it's hard?\n\nSAM\nHmm?\n\nLISA\nIt's hard?\n\nSAM\nIt's hard under the best circumstances. Obviously, it got a little harder\ntwo weeks ago.\n\nLISA\nWhat happened two weeks ago?\n\nSam looks at Lisa, who realizes what it was.\n\nLISA\nCongress censured the President.\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\nTwo weeks ago, Toby, Sam, Josh and C.J. are waiting in Leo's office. Leo,\nwho just walked\nin, is bringing troubling news.\n\nLEO\nGood morning.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEO\nLate last night, early this morning, the President reached an agreement with\nthe\nLeadership to accept a Congressional Censure.\n\nThe room falls silent for a minute. The staff certainly isn't pleased.\n\nC.J.\nHow's he feeling?\n\nLEO\nHmm?\n\nC.J.\nHow's he feeling?\n\nLEO\nFine. It's over.\n\nSAM\nJoint Resolution?\n\nLEO\nYeah. A Concurrent Resolution, actually. It'll take a couple of days for\nthe lawyers to\nget together on the language.\n\nC.J.\nWe should leak in the meantime, soften up the ground?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nHe's all right?\n\nLEO\nHe's about to be censured, and then he's gonna deliver the State of the Union,\nand then\nhe's gonna run for reelection. My guess is that there are some things on\nhis mind.\n[long pause] It's over. That's all.\n\nC.J.\nThank you.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nToby, Sam, and C.J. exit, while Josh remains on his seat. Leo, now with\nglasses on, just\nlooks at Josh, who touches his head.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nJust after hearing the news, Toby, Sam, and C.J. enter the empty Roosevelt\nRoom.\n\nSAM\nThis is like the Civil War. When's the last time Congress rebuked a sitting\npresident?\n\nTOBY\nThe Civil War.\n\nSAM\nAnd now, how do you...?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nShould we postpone the State of the Union? What are the rules on that?\n\nAfter wandering the hallway, Josh enters.\n\nTOBY\nHe's required to give Congress information on the State of the Union. If he\nbuys Congress\na subscription to the Wall Street Journal, he's fulfilled his\nConstitutional...\n\nSAM\nPostponing or canceling's an admission of defeat.\n\nC.J.\nHe's accepting a censure. That is defeat. And you don't ask the school bully\nout to lunch\nthe day after he stole your lunch money.\n\nSAM\nYou don't go on a starvation diet, either. And we can spin the censure as\na bipartisan...\n\nC.J.\nYou can't spin a formal denunciation from the legislative branch. It spins\nitself.\n\nSAM\nI don't...\n\nC.J.\nIt's our biggest press hit of the year, our biggest pre-convention campaign\nexposure. I\ndon't know how you make a formal report to Congress when Congress just called\nyou a liar.\n\nJOSH\nI say we strap a polygraph onto the TelePrompTer.\n\nNo response.\n\nJOSH [CONT.]\nHumor--to lighten the load... I recommended that he take the censure and if\nany of you\nhad been on the inside, you'd have recommended it too. How does he deliver\nthe State of\nthe Union in two weeks? He's the President of the United States. When he\nwalks into the\nHouse chamber, they're all gonna stand up. Anyone here not believe this\nPresident can\ntake it from there? I still got my lunch money. Toby? Sam? You got to dig\nin. [pause]\nAnything else?\n\nJosh chuckles, which C.J. returns back.\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nC.J.\nHey Sam.\n\nSAM\nYes?\n\nC.J.\nWell argued.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nSam and C.J. exit and walk and talk in the HALLWAY.\n\nSAM\nWhat do you want?\n\nC.J.\nWhat kind of attitude is that?\n\nSAM\nC.J....\n\nC.J.\nVanity Fair's pitching my office a story on you.\n\nSAM\nWhat's the angle?\n\nC.J.\nThey want to do a profile, and they want to start the reporting on the night\nof the State\nof the Union.\n\nSAM\nWhy don't they just cover the State of the Union address?\n\nC.J.\nThis is their way of doing that. The thing is... you know the writer.\n\nSAM\nWho?\n\nC.J.\nLisa Sherborne.\n\nSAM\nThat's funny 'cause I used to be engaged to someone named Lisa Sherborne.\n\nC.J.\nIsn't it funny?\n\nSAM\nI'm not doing it.\n\nC.J.\nI'd like you to.\n\nThey exchange looks before they enter SAM'S OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nWhat happened to rule number one on staff profiles being that we don't do\nstaff profiles?\n\nC.J.\nWhen did we have that rule?\n\nSAM\nWe should have that rule. Keep the focus on the President. People should\nthink he writes\nthe State of the Union.\n\nC.J.\nI think people know about speechwriters.\n\nSAM\nThen there's no more story to tell.\n\nC.J.\nIn the past, you tell me. Did it help or hurt that the campaign had a youthful\nand\nenergetic energy?\n\nSAM\nI'm not sure you can say \"energetic energy.\"\n\nC.J.\nDid it help or hurt?\n\nSAM\nIt helped.\n\nC.J.\nDo we need help right now? Do young women read Vanity Fair?\n\nSAM\nSo let them cover the President.\n\nC.J.\nThey do cover the President. Right now they want you, and I want to give\nyou to them.\n\nSAM\n[pause] It's got to be Lisa Sherborne?\n\nC.J.\nHey, is the reason you guys didn't get married is 'cause her name would have\nbeen Lisa\nSherborne Seaborn?\n\nSAM\nYeah. That's the reason.\n\nC.J.\nI could do this for a living. [exits]\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - PRESENT\nThe night of the State of the Union, Sam is seated by one of the tables in\nthe room,\nwhich has been conveniently turned into a party dining area for the special\nnight.\nC.J. passes by Sam, but his gaze is focused on Joey and Kenny, who pass\nthrough the\nCommunications Bullpen. In the HALLWAY, Sam meets Joey and Kenny as they\nexit the bullpen.\n\nSAM\nDo you have anything?\n\nJOEY\nNo.\n\nSAM\nI don't believe you.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI don't have anything.\n\nSAM\nIf you didn't have anything, you wouldn't be out here at the party.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI like parties.\n\nSAM\nWhat do you have?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI have the first 20 minutes.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nYou don't want the first 20 minutes.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nJOEY\nSam... Hi.\n\nJoey sees Lisa, who just walked up from behind Sam.\n\nLISA\nHi.\n\nSAM\n[to Lisa] I just need a minute, okay?\n\nLISA\nI can wait.\n\nSAM\nI need you to wait over there.\n\nLISA\nOkay.\n\nLisa goes into the Roosevelt Room. Joey, Kenny, and Sam step inside the\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nOFFICE for privacy.\n\nSAM\nWhy don't I want the first 20 minutes?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nIt's what we expected it would be.\n\nSAM\nTell me.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nIt was the censure. People saw it was...\n\nSAM\nJust tell me.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nDemocrats, low to mid 50s. Republicans, high 30s.\n\nSAM\nIndependents?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nLow 40s.\n\nSAM\nYou're kidding me.\n\nJOEY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nLow 40s?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWe knew the first 20 minutes...\n\nSAM\nTen minutes. You said ten minutes and not this bad.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWait for the rest of the dials.\n\nSAM\nWe did Internet commerce in the first 20 minutes. We did child asthma...\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nHe wasn't the President in the first 20 minutes. Wait for the rest of the\ndial groups.\n\nSAM\nTop line, cross-tabs, whatever you get, I got a bad feeling about tonight.\n\nSam exits and sees Lisa seated in the ROOSEVELT ROOM, drinking. He approaches,\nand she\nstands up before he could say anything.\n\nLISA\nWere those polling numbers?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nLISA\nWhat was that about?\n\nSAM\nIt was polling numbers, but it was... it was nothing.\n\nLISA\nHow's it look?\n\nSAM\nIt's too early to tell.\n\nThey sit, and they exchange smiles in the process.\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\nFADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT\nSam and Lisa are still seated by their table. Ed and Larry walk up.\n\nED\nSam...\n\nLARRY\nCongratulations.\n\nSAM\nYou too. Ed, Larry, this is Lisa Sherborne from Vanity Fair.\n\nLISA\nUh, which one's Ed, which one's Larry?\n\nED and LARRY\nDoesn't matter.\n\nLARRY\n[to Sam] Joey went back to the office.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nEd and Larry leave.\n\nLISA\nYou don't have to introduce me as Lisa Sherborne from Vanity Fair.\n\nSAM\nI like to let them know they're talking to a reporter.\n\nLISA\nYou really are uncomfortable with me being here, right? You're not just,\nyou know, being\nyou.\n\nSAM\nI don't know what that means.\n\nLISA\nHow did curing cancer get cut from the State of the Union?\n\nSAM\nA lot of things got cut.\n\nLISA\nCuring cancer?\n\nSAM\nHey, we had to cut a section about making government manuals easier to read,\nso curing\ncancer can take a number.\n\nLISA\nWhy are you pissed at me?\n\nSAM\nI'm not pissed at you. I'm working.\n\nLISA\nYou're done working.\n\nSAM\nI'm not done working. You're confused because you see Absolut Cosmopolitans\nand famous\npeople.\n\nLISA\n[laughs softly] A section on government manuals.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY\nTwo weeks ago, Donna is reading a monster of a book on her desk. Josh walks\nup.\n\nJOSH\nDonna?\n\nDONNA\nYeah?\n\nJOSH\nCan you get me the most recent memo from the DPC on the welfare-to-work\ninitiatives?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nDonna's attention is still on the big book. Josh changes the subject.\n\nJOSH\nI'm seeing Amy again tonight.\n\nDONNA\nSecond date?\n\nJOSH\nFirst date really. Last night was more of a, you know...\n\nDONNA\nScheme.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nGood, 'cause the second date's usually where the wheels come off the wagon\nfor you.\n\nJOSH\nThat is so false.\n\nDONNA\nWhat are you doing?\n\nJOSH\nA late drink.\n\nDONNA\nWhere are you going?\n\nJOSH\nWilson's.\n\nDONNA\nI like that place.\n\nJOSH\nI don't.\n\nDONNA\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\nWell, for one thing, the piano player only seems to know one song.\n\nDONNA\nWhich song?\n\nJOSH\n\"Little things with fur better hurry...\"\n\nDONNA\n\"Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry.\"\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nDONNA\n\"Surrey With a Fringe on Top.\"\n\nJOSH\nWhatever. It's like I'm on a hayride.\n\nDonna walks over to a file cabinet Josh is standing next to. She pulls out\na file from up\ntop and reads.\n\nJOSH\nWhat are you doing?\n\nDONNA\nI'm trying to figure out if you have to pay for the plane ticket to Phoenix.\n\nJOSH\nIt was official travel.\n\nDONNA\nYeah, well, that doesn't really seem to make a difference...\n\nJOSH\nWhat does the rule say?\n\nDonna sits back down, sighs, and reads from the big book.\n\nDONNA\nAn employee may not use contract airline/rail passenger service provided\nunder the\ncontract with the General Services Administration. See part 301-15 subpart\nB of this\nchapter.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's the problem?\n\nDONNA\nWell, let's set aside that there's no subpart B. The rest of it uses a\nsentence\nstructure with which I'm not familiar.\n\nJOSH\n[starts for his office] Just put it on my credit card.\n\nDONNA\nNo. See, I think this is what it's designed to do. I think it's designed to\nbreak a\nperson's spirit.\n\nJOSH\nAnd damn it, that's my job.\n\nDONNA\nWe're getting beat by the system.\n\nJOSH\nWe are the system.\n\nDONNA\nWe suck.\n\nJOSH\nYes. I need the welfare-to-work memo.\n\nJosh reaches his office. Donna turns to the hallway and meets Toby, who has\nbeen walking\nvery slowly, seeming very distracted.\n\nDONNA\nHow many words in the Gettysburg address?\n\nTOBY\n266.\n\nDONNA\nAnd the Ten Commandments?\n\nTOBY\n173.\n\nDONNA\nSo you really wouldn't think you'd need 6000 to discover how a plane ticket\ngets\nreimbursed.\n\nTOBY\nNo.\n\nDONNA\nNo.\n\nDonna walks off. Toby stands still, looking into Josh's office. Josh was\nabout to come\nout, a phone rings somewhere, and he goes back in. Toby puts his hand on\nthe wall,\nplaying with it a little as he walks forward, slower than usual. Josh looks\nat him from\ninside his office.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's going on?\n\nJOSH\nWelfare-to-work.\n\nBoth of them walk and meet each other in the hallway.\n\nTOBY\nI was happy when you said this morning that you recommended the censure.\n\nJOSH\nYour face didn't register much.\n\nTOBY\nI was thinking about the speech.\n\nJOSH\nI figured.\n\nTOBY\nDon't ask me how it's going.\n\nJOSH\nI wouldn't.\n\nTOBY\nIt's in the larva stage. You can't rush these things. It's not like putting\na hammer\nto a nail. [pause] I need some pie.\n\nJOSH\nYou should go get some. [starts to walk off]\n\nTOBY\n[pause] Come with me.\n\nToby seemed a little surprised with what he said. Josh, surprised as well,\nturns around\nto face him.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nTOBY\nDon't ask me about the speech.\n\nJOSH\nWouldn't do it.\n\nThe two start walking. They will end up past the lobby and down the stairs.\n\nTOBY\nHow'd it end up going last night?\n\nJOSH\nWith Amy Gardner?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nVery, very well.\n\nDonna passes them and gives Josh something.\n\nDONNA\nHere's the memo.\n\nJOSH\nThank you.\n\nTOBY\nYou know Amy's seeing somebody.\n\nJOSH\nI do know that.\n\nTOBY\nYou know who?\n\nJOSH\nNo, and I don't want to know. Yes, now that you mention it, who?\n\nTOBY\nJohn Tandy.\n\nJOSH\nReally?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\n[pause] Really.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nInteresting.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nIt's interesting, and I'll tell you why.\n\nTOBY\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\nBecause John Tandy is a...\n\nTOBY\nI'll tell you why, seriously.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\n'Cause they started seeing each other shortly after Nan Lieberman announced\nhe was gonna\nmake a primary challenge in the 20th district.\n\nJOSH\nReally?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nAh-so.\n\nTOBY\nI don't think he's courting Amy Gardner. I think he's courting women.\n\nJOSH\nI don't think you're right.\n\nTOBY\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\n'Cause that's ridiculous.\n\nTOBY\nReally?\n\nJOSH\nNo. It's not ridiculous. Of course, you're right.\n\nTOBY\n[sighs] Hey, who's the President having dinner with tonight?\n\nJOSH\nFriends of Abbey.\n\nTOBY\nGood, 'cause when you're in this kind of mood, having dinner with your wife's\nfriends\nis just what you're hoping for.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE RESIDENTIAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT\nThat night, Bartlet is indeed having dinner with Abbey's friends, who,\napparently, are\nall oncologists. Chamber music plays in the well-lit dining room, but Abbey\nis not\npresent at the moment.\n\nWOMAN\nIt's molecular pathology.\n\nMAN 1\nS.T.I.\n\nMAN 2\n[to Bartlet] That's the Signal Transduction Inhibitor.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry?\n\nMAN 1\nS.T.I. stands for Signal Transduction Inhibitor.\n\nBARTLET\nAbbey just went to take a phone call.\n\nBartlet looks down at his dessert and plays with the spoon, barely listening\nto the\nconversation. Something else is obviously in his mind.\n\nWOMAN\nWe've tested it on 12 patients.\n\nMAN 1\nIs this the first drug that targets sphingosine kinase?\n\nWOMAN\nIt is. Yeah. The first drug.\n\nMAN 2\nWhere are you with the FDA?\n\nMAN 1\nThe FDA just ruled they can use higher doses.\n\nWOMAN\nThis, they did.\n\nAnother man, BOBBY, who just went and got his cup of coffee, joins in on\nthe conversation.\n\nBOBBY\nI'm telling you, we're ten years, 25 billion dollars and a good luck charm\naway from\ncuring human cancer.\n\nMAN 2\nMore than 25 billion dollars, but the point is...\n\nMAN 1\nTwo and three more breakthroughs in molecular targeting...\n\nWOMAN\nWhich is what the Signal Transduction Inhibitor is all about.\n\nBartlet heard something that appealed to him. He looks up.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Bobby] What did you just say?\n\nWOMAN\nWe're talking about a new drug, which is a signal transduction\ninhibitor. Sphingosine\nkinase was identified recently as the enzyme believed to control all signal\npathways\nto cancer growth. This new drug can act as a kind of, guided missile.\n\nMAN 1\nSmart bomb.\n\nWOMAN\nYeah. That destroys cancer cells without killing the healthy ones.\n\nBARTLET\nRight. The part I understand was Bobby saying we could cure cancer in ten\nyears.\n\nBOBBY\nNot cure it, but make it chronic.\n\nBARTLET\nIn other words, make it so that people could live with it?\n\nBOBBY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat is standing between us and that happening?\n\nWOMAN\nI don't know.\n\nBARTLET\nWho at this table knows?\n\nWOMAN\nNobody knows.\n\nBARTLET\nHow much money would it cost?\n\nWOMAN\nNobody knows that, either.\n\nBARTLET\nHe just said...\n\nWOMAN\nIt's cancer. Nobody knows anything.\n\nBARTLET\nHe just said ten years. I want to hear about this from the beginning. Talk\nto me like\nI'm not an oncologist.\n\nEveryone else looks at each other.\n\nBARTLET [CONT.]\nI'm not messing around. This isn't barbecue night. I'm the\nCommander-in-Chief. Put your\nasses in the chairs.\n\nEveryone standing takes his or her seats.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT\nFrom inside, we follow a man as he walks down the hallway. We stop just as\nhe passes\nthe Communications Office. From a distance, we see Toby exiting his office\nand going\ninto Sam's. He crumples a piece of paper in his hand.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nToby throws the crumpled paper as he enters. Sam is at his desk typing.\n\nTOBY\nI'm out of pie.\n\nSAM\nWe'll get some more.\n\nToby plays with his mouth and savors the last of his pie. He picks up some\nkind of\nsnack on a table and starts eating it.\n\nTOBY\nSo how's it going on the uh... what are you doing?\n\nSAM\nThe economy. I'm getting somewhere.\n\nTOBY\nI can look at it when you're ready.\n\nSAM\nHow about another two hours?\n\nTOBY\nLisa's gonna do a piece?\n\nSAM\nIt wasn't my idea.\n\nTOBY\nI wouldn't think so.\n\nSam stands and picks up a newspaper from outside his door, then comes back\nto his desk.\n\nSAM\nC.J. asked me if the reason we didn't get married was because her name\nwould've been\nLisa Sherborne Seaborn.\n\nTOBY\nThat's funny.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\n[pause] So why didn't you get married?\n\nSAM\nHmm?\n\nTOBY\nWhy didn't you?\n\nSAM\nShe didn't like me very much. [sits back down]\n\nTOBY\nAh.\n\nToby and Sam immediately see Bartlet in the hallway, accompanied by an agent,\nas he\nheads for the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. They meet as Bartlet enters.\n\nTOBY\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nSAM\nGood evening, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI want to call everybody in. I just had dinner with some of Abbey's\nfriends. They're\nall oncologists. I think in the State of the Union, I can announce that I'm\ndirecting\nour researchers to have a cure for cancer in ten years. Call everybody in.\n\nBartlet and his agent leave. Stunned, Toby and Sam exchange looks.\n\nTOBY\nThis is about the censure.\n\nToby goes in his office. Sam waits a moment, then enters his office as\nwell. From out-\nside, we FOCUS on the seal at the door that says, \"THE WHITE HOUSE\nCOMMUNICATIONS DEPT.\"\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT. WILSON'S BAR - NIGHT\nThe piano player plays \"Surrey With a Fringe on Top.\" The place is filled\nwith fancy\ndressed people, all of whom are conversing with each other. Somewhere inside,\nJosh is\nwith Amy. It's their \"first date.\"\n\nAMY\nWhat did you just say?\n\nJOSH\nI said it for your own good.\n\nAMY\nDid you?\n\nJOSH\nI did. I like you.\n\nAMY\nI hate you.\n\nJOSH\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nAMY\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\nHe was polling at 69% among Democrats. And that's all Tandy's got in his\ndistrict.\n\nAMY\nCongressman Tandy.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. He had a 69% favorability rating with women. You need 93%\nfavorability among\nmen to beat that, and Mahatma Gandhi doesn't get that in the Florida 20th.\n\nAMY\nSomebody's been studying.\n\nJOSH\nWhen Nan Lieberman announces that she might challenge him in the primary,\nhis favorability\ngoes down to 52%. You know why?\n\nAMY\n'Cause you're an idiot?\n\nJOSH\n'Cause women started going over to Lieberman.\n\nAMY\nLook...\n\nJOSH\nWomen's groups started hedging saying there aren't enough women in\nCongress. Tandy needs\nwomen. NOW hasn't endorsed him yet.\n\nAMY\nIt's January.\n\nJOSH\nYes. Still, when did he start going out with you? A week after Lieberman\nannounced.\n\nAMY\nHow do you know when we started going out?\n\nJOSH\nI know everything. And you are the door to women. The WLC put nine million\ndollars in the\nhands of pro-choice candidates. You narrowed the gap in the House from 14\nto nine in one\nelection. You bring home the bacon.\n\nAMY\nYou think John's worried about losing women? He runs and Emily's List\npractically makes\na wire transfer. He crushed his last opponent in Lauderhill -- I don't even\nremember his\nname -- but he was a moderate pro-choice Republican, and there was 29% gender\ndifferential. You think he's going around with me 'cause he's afraid of Nan\nLieberman?\n\nJOSH\nI do.\n\nAMY\n[chuckles] Well, I've never been so flattered in my life.\n\nJOSH\nI don't think I'm getting enough credit for saying this for your own good.\n\nAMY\nDon't talk to me.\n\nJOSH\nLook...\n\nAMY\nDon't talk to me.\n\nJOSH\nWe're changing the sub...\n\nAMY\nYou're talking to me.\n\nJOSH\nPerhaps...\n\nAMY\nDon't talk to me.\n\nJOSH\nI should just sit here?\n\nAMY\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nAnd?\n\nAMY\nNot talk to me.\n\nJOSH\nAmy...\n\nAMY\nI have wit, I have charm, I have brains, I have legs that go all the way\ndown to the\nfloor, my friend.\n\nJOSH\nYou don't have to...\n\nAMY\nDon't talk to me.\n\nJosh watches as Amy walks away. Seconds later, his cell phone rings. It's\nToby.\n\nJOSH\nHello?\n\nTOBY\nJosh?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nYou got to come back.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\nThe President thinks he can cure cancer.\n\nJOSH\nWell, that's some good news, I guess.\n\nTOBY\nYeah. I'll see you in a few minutes.\n\nJosh hangs up.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\nJoey and Kenny, who have just been called in, are walking with Charlie in\nthe hallway.\nThey're heading for a meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nDid he find a cure for cancer? 'Cause if he found a cure for cancer, I think\nthat would\nbe interesting. I think that was something we should share.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nBut he didn't. He wants to find a cure for cancer, and he wants to say that\nin the State\nof the Union. You know what my response would be? Me, too, but is this the\nfirst time you\nhad that thought?\n\nCHARLIE\nSign \"union\" again. That was cool.\n\nJoey signs the word.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo. It must have been a different word.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nIs he serious about this?\n\nCHARLIE\nThat's not my department. I get you to the meeting.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nRight.\n\nCHARLIE\nJoey?\n\nJOEY\nYes?\n\nCHARLIE\nHow high are the stakes for the speech?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThey're high. But a magic trick isn't gonna help.\n\nCHARLIE\nHow high?\n\nJOEY\nHigh.\n\nCHARLIE\nHow high?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWell, you don't win anything in January. You only lose. If he doesn't park\nthe State of\nthe Union, and I mean deep, it'll be his last one.\n\nCHARLIE\nAll right. You're in the Oval Office.\n\nJoey nods and steps into the Outer Office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT\nJosh enters and sees Ed and Larry walking by.\n\nJOSH\nHey, did I hear Toby right on the phone?\n\nLARRY\nCould be worse, you know.\n\nJOSH\nHow?\n\nLARRY\nHe could have cancer.\n\nJOSH\nDo the two of you ever go anywhere separately?\n\nED\nIt's weird, isn't it?\n\nJOSH\nA little weird. Yeah.\n\nEd and Larry walk off. Josh continues on his way.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nSam, Toby, C.J., Joey and Kenny have been waiting. Josh walks in.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's going on? What was that phone call?\n\nTOBY\nWe're gonna meet and talk. [beat] How'd it go?\n\nJOSH\nNot at all well. You know whose fault that is?\n\nTOBY\nJohn Tandy's?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nTOBY\nHers?\n\nJOSH\nYours.\n\nLEO\nLet's go.\n\nLeo had just opened the door from inside and invites everyone into the OVAL\nOFFICE.\n\nTOBY\nLeo, is he serious...?\n\nLEO\nHe's on his way down.\n\nToby closes the door when everyone else gets in.\n\nJOSH\nTotally your fault.\n\nTOBY\nI'm just, you know... I'm just the guy who does the thing.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nWe've run out of pie.\n\nFrom the portico, Bartlet steps in.\n\nBARTLET\nGood evening. Thanks for being here so late.\n\nALL\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nA President stood up. He said we will land a man on the moon before the end\nof the\ndecade. You know what we knew when he said that? Nothing. We didn't know\nanything.\nWe didn't know about the lunar surface. We didn't know how to land one of\nthese things.\nAll we'd ever done is crash it into the ocean. And God knows we could figure\nout how to\nland soft. We didn't know how to blast off again, but a President said we're\ngonna do it,\nand we did it. So I ask you, why shouldn't I stand up and say we are going\nto cure\ncancer in ten years?\n\nSilence in the room. No one responds.\n\nBARTLET [CONT.]\nI'm really asking.\n\nJOSH\nWell, how close are we to really being able to do this?\n\nBARTLET\nNobody knows.\n\nJOSH\nThen...\n\nBARTLET\nToby.\n\nTOBY\nIt'll be seen as a political ploy.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nIt can be seen... [to Toby] Excuse me. [to Bartlet] It can be seen as\nself-serving.\n\nBARTLET\nHow?\n\nC.J.\nUsing cancer to deflect attention from MS.\n\nBARTLET\nYou think people with cancer care what my motives are? You think their\nfamilies do?\n\nC.J.\nI'm saying...\n\nBARTLET\nJoey?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI agree with everything that's been said, except, I don't think they'll see\nit as\ndeflecting the MS. I think they'll see it as deflecting the censure.\n\nBARTLET\nOnce again, why would somebody...?\n\nJOEY\nEverybody cares about motive, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nI didn't...\n\nKENNY\nShe said, \"Everybody cares about motive,\" sir.\n\nBARTLET\nSam.\n\nSAM\nYes sir?\n\nBARTLET\nWhy shouldn't I do it?\n\nSAM\nI think you should. I think ambition is good. I think overreaching is good. I\nthink\ngiving people a vision of government that's more than Social Security checks\nand debt\nreduction is good. I think government should be optimistic.\n\nBartlet nods, turns to look at Leo, then back to his staff.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry. I know it's late, but I want to start seeing drafts of a new\nsection in the\nnext few hours. C.J., I want a sense of a media overview, too.\n\nC.J. nods, but nobody moves instantly.\n\nBARTLET\nNow.\n\nALL\nYes, sir. Thank you, sir.\n\nThe staff exits. Bartlet goes behind his desk, and Leo gives him a knowing\nlook.\n\nBARTLET\nI just want to look at some drafts.\n\nLeo exits to his office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - NIGHT\nAfter the meeting, Sam and Toby walk in.\n\nTOBY\nI don't have an hour and a half to spend on this.\n\nSAM\nI can do it.\n\nTOBY\nYou don't have an hour and a half to spend on it either.\n\nSAM\nWhy are you opposed to this?\n\nTOBY\nStopping what we're doing to write about curing cancer?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\n'Cause it's never gonna be in the speech.\n\nSAM\nHow do you know?\n\nToby goes into his office just as Joey and Kenny enter.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWhat resources do we have to devote?\n\nSAM\nI don't know.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nHow much money is it gonna cost?\n\nSAM\nI don't know.\n\nTOBY\n[exits his office] That's how I know.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThe man's about to get a Congressional Censure. He's trying to pull a rabbit\nout of his\nhat. What are you doing humoring him?\n\nSAM\nI'm not humoring him.\n\nTOBY\nI don't want you spending more than an hour and half. [goes to his office]\n\nSAM\nYou're a pollster.\n\nJOEY\nYes.\n\nSAM\nYou don't think this will poll well?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nDo I think people are in favor of curing cancer? Yes, I do.\n\nSAM\nSo?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nBut federal government shouldn't be directing scientific research.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nBecause you stink at it. If it was up to the NIH to cure polio through a\ncentrally\ndirected program instead of an independent investigator driven discovery,\nyou'd have\nthe best iron lung in the world, but not a polio vaccine.\n\nSAM\nWhen did you get an M.D.?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI was just quoting Samuel Broder.\n\nSAM\nWho's he?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThe former director of the National Cancer Institute. The speech is gonna\nwork fine.\nDon't overreact to the censure.\n\nSAM\nThere is no speech yet.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThere will be.\n\nSAM\nI have to work now. The President asked me to try this.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nI'll be in my office. [exits with Kenny]\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - PRESENT\nBack at the State of the Union party, Joey and Kenny walk down the hallway\ntalking,\nobviously by means of signing. Josh comes up from behind.\n\nJOSH\nListen... When the hell are we getting numbers?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nYou are a pleasure to work for.\n\nJOSH\nI hear that a lot. When are we getting numbers?\n\nJOEY\nWhen I say so.\n\nJoey and Kenny walk away. Donna, on the other hand, walks quietly from behind\nJosh.\n\nDONNA\nSo many women, so little charm.\n\nJOSH\nWhat in God's name could you possibly want right now?\n\nDONNA\n[faces him] Let me tell you something. Making government manuals easier to\nread?\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nDONNA\nWould have been a winner.\n\nAmy suddenly passes by behind Josh and smacks him hard on the head.\n\nAMY\nCome with me.\n\nJOSH\n[to Donna] Excuse me.\n\nJosh follows Amy, until they reach a deserted hallway, not far from the party.\n\nAMY\n[whispers] He happens to be more feminist than the White House.\n\nJOSH\nI have no idea what you just said.\n\nAMY\nI said he happens to be more feminist than the White House.\n\nJOSH\nFeminine?\n\nAMY\nFeminist. He wrote the amendment to the HHS Appropriations Bill that made\nviolence near\nabortion clinics a federal crime while you guys were seeking legal commentary.\n\nJOSH\nForgive us for talking to lawyers about the law.\n\nAMY\nHe almost single-handedly beat back three parental consent bills, and on\ntwo of them,\nhe ran his own damn whip operation because they weren't Leadership priorities.\n\nJOSH\nThe Minority Whip doesn't work for us.\n\nAMY\nAnd he ties the Violence Against Women Act to the last crime bill...\n\nJOSH\nAmy...\n\nAMY\n...over White House objection.\n\nJOSH\nI'm not quarreling with his credentials as a lover of women. I happen to\nknow he excels\nin that area.\n\nAMY\nLook who's talking.\n\nJOSH\nI'm just saying...\n\nAMY\nThat he's using me.\n\nJOSH\nI was saying that. I was saying it two weeks ago. Now I'm not saying anything\nin the\nvicinity of that.\n\nFrom the other end of the hallway, someone walks up. It's Congressman JOHN\nTANDY.\n\nTANDY\nHey.\n\nAMY\nHey.\n\nJOSH\nCongressman.\n\nTANDY\nJosh, great night for us.\n\nJOSH\nWe'll see. [They shake hands.]\n\nTANDY\nAmy, we're doing some pictures with the President in the Mural Room.\n\nAMY\nYou don't want to do them yourself?\n\nTANDY\nNo. Come on.\n\nTandy starts to walk off. Josh and Amy exchange looks.\n\nJOSH\nGo ahead. Photo-op.\n\nAmy begins to leave, but she stops and looks back one more time. Tandy,\nalready a few\nsteps ahead, calls her.\n\nTANDY\nAmy.\n\nAMY\nYeah. [joins him]\n\nTANDY\n[to Josh] Congratulations.\n\nJosh watches as Amy and the Congressman step away.\n\nJOSH\n[to himself] Hmm. We'll see.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - LATE NIGHT\nTwo weeks before the State of the Union, Sam knocks at the open door. Bartlet\nis at his\ndesk, reading.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Come on in.\n\nSam steps in and walks up to the desk.\n\nSAM\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYou got it?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nHe gives Bartlet a piece of paper, which he reads, all the while pacing the\nroom.\nBartlet finds himself seated on a chair.\n\nBARTLET\nThis is good.\n\nSAM\nYou know we can't do it.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nWe need to line up experts who can face the press, and in just two weeks.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nSloane-Kettering, Dana-Farber, The Cleveland Clinic, UCLA.\n\nBARTLET\nWe'd want to include the Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nSAM\nAnd the NCI.\n\nBARTLET\nThe OMB would have to score it. We haven't identified the offsets to pay\nfor it. We can\nbarely tell them what the it is.\n\nSAM\nClinical trials under Medicare and Medicaid, Science and Technology Democrats,\nthe\npharmaceutical companies.\n\nBARTLET\n[sighs] It was a good idea though.\n\nSAM\nWe have other good ideas.\n\nBARTLET\nSo we don't get water from a rock. We just do our thing and take our chances.\n\nSAM\nI think so.\n\nBARTLET\n[stands] We're gonna have to do it awfully well this time.\n\nSAM\nWe've done that before.\n\nBartlet gives Sam the draft back.\n\nBARTLET\nAnything else?\n\nSAM\n[shakes his head] Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nSam exits. Bartlet walks back to his desk.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - PRESENT\nAt the State of the Union party, C.J. is conversing with two men. Nearby,\nKenny calls her.\n\nKENNY\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\n[to the men] Would you excuse me?\n\nC.J., with drink in her hand, walks down the hallway to JOSH'S BULLPEN\nAREA. Almost\nevery staffer in the place is gathered around Joey and Kenny. As soon as\nC.J. arrives,\nJoey starts.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nWell, something happened at the half-hour mark.\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\nThey remembered why they liked him in the first place. The breakdowns are\nbeing handed\naround, but the really good news are the panel backs. Sixteen Democrats,\n16 Republicans,\nand 12 Independents were asked identical questions two days ago and one hour\nago. Two\ndays ago, 48% said he was able to handle his job effectively. Tonight,\nthat number's 59.\n\nSome sounds of amazement and relief from everyone.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\n\"Trustworthy,\" 60%, up from 41.\n\nTOBY\nGive us the real one.\n\nJOEY [KENNY]\n\"Strong leader...\" [with a smile] 69%.\n\nStrong, loud, and motivating cheers come from everyone. The place is lifted\nup with joy\nand rapture, as they smile and applaud.\n\nJOSH\n[arms up in the air] We're back! Yes! Yes!\n\nSam and Toby hug. Josh kisses Joey. He then goes to Donna, kisses and hugs\nher. C.J. gives\nToby a handful of lip smacks. Sam exchanges a high five with Larry as Ed\ncheers nearby.\nJosh lifts C.J. up in the air. From the end of the hall, staffers make way\nand applaud as\nBartlet walks up, with Leo behind him. Bartlet puts his arms around Sam and\nToby.\n\nBARTLET\nSomebody get these guys some pie.\n\nSmiles and laughter continue.\n\nC.J.\nJoey, is there an extra copy of the panel backs? I didn't get one.\n\nKENNY\nI got one.\n\nC.J.\nThanks.\n\nShe takes the copy and makes a run for her office, passing by Toby.\n\nTOBY\nC.J.!\n\nC.J.\nHang on.\n\nTOBY\nDance with me!\n\nC.J.\nHang on! I'm just gonna toss this in my office.\n\nAs C.J. enters her office, Carol walks in behind her.\n\nCAROL\nCongratulations, boss.\n\nC.J.\nNice job. Take the rest of the night off.\n\nCAROL\nYeah. It's one in the morning.\n\nC.J.\nWell, you earned it.\n\nSam knocks and enters. Carol exits.\n\nC.J.\nSam, Sam, sunshine man. Get on the couch, I'm gonna do you right now.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nSorry, I was still talking to Carol.\n\nSAM\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nC.J.\nWe really don't know. [laughs] Lisa mentioned that it wasn't going that well\ntonight.\nYou still got a couple of weeks with her, you'll...\n\nSAM\nYeah. I wish that we hadn't started tonight.\n\nC.J.\nWhy? It was a shining moment.\n\nSAM\nIt got the job done, but it's ironic, 'cause that thing, sort of, a thing\nbetween us is\nI'm supposed to know the difference between flash and substance.\n\nC.J.\nSometimes a little flash is what's required. You said that to me.\n\nSAM\nI say that when I don't have anything to say.\n\nC.J.\nIt wasn't a Vegas act. It was stirring. And I wouldn't hang your head when\nyou say it\ngot the job done. That job was impossible and it had to be done. There aren't\nten guys\nin the country who could write that speech.\n\nSAM\nI bet the Cancer Committee can't wait to buy me a beer.\n\nC.J. puts a hand on Sam's chest.\n\nSAM\nHey, I'm just, you know. Anyway, congratulations. And if you're serious\nabout that thing\nwith Carol, I can just sit in the corner and not even say...\n\nC.J.\n[laughs] Get out.\n\nC.J. takes a sip of her drink as Sam leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - NIGHT\nSam leads Lisa inside.\n\nSAM\nSorry. I was just getting some polling numbers.\n\nLISA\nCan you tell me what they were?\n\nSAM\nThey're internal numbers. CNN/USA Today will have something in a little\nwhile. Anyway,\nthis is my office over here.\n\nLISA\nSam, I'm gonna give my notes from tonight to someone else and let them finish\nthe\nreporting over the next few weeks. You're obviously not comfortable with this.\n\nSAM\nThey're internal numbers, Lisa, I can't...\n\nLISA\nYeah, whatever. I'm gonna give my notes to someone else.\n\nSAM\n[pause] Anyway... [shows Lisa inside his office] This is my office.\n\nLISA\nIt's nice.\n\nSAM\n[pause] C.J. asked me a couple of weeks ago if the reason we didn't get\nmarried is\nbecause your name would be Sherborne Seaborn.\n\nLISA\nThat's exactly why we didn't get married.\n\nSAM\n[pause] Why didn't we get married?\n\nLISA\nWhy do you think?\n\nSAM\n'Cause I don't know what the cool restaurant is, and I don't care. When I\nget hungry,\nI want to eat. And I don't know where the Tommy Hilfiger party is, and I\ndon't know\nwhat to do once I get there.\n\nLISA\nYou're full of crap.\n\nSAM\nI was never cool enough for you.\n\nLISA\nYou're full of crap, and you think too little of me, and I didn't leave\nyou. You left me,\nand you did it to do this, and the reason you're pissy is 'cause I'm here\nlooking at you\nand writing about you, and you're wondering if I'm gonna think you've been\ndoing anything\nat all.\n\nSAM\nOften it's not clear to me whether or not I have.\n\nLISA\nYou have.\n\nSAM\nHow would you know?\n\nLISA\nI don't know.\n\nSAM\n[pause] Here's something interesting. In 1940, our armed forces weren't\namong the 12\nmost formidable in the world, but obviously we were gonna fight a big war. And\nRoosevelt\nsaid the U.S. would produce 50,000 planes in the next four years. Everyone\ntaught it was\na joke, and it was. 'Cause it turned out we produced 100,000 planes. Gave\nthe air force\nan armada that would block the sun.\n\nLISA\nDo you still have what you wrote that night?\n\nSAM\nAbout curing cancer?\n\nLISA\nYeah.\n\nSam walks to his desk and fiddles with his laptop. He shows Lisa his draft\non curing\ncancer.\n\nLISA\nRead it to me. [sits]\n\nSAM\n[reads] \"Over the past half-century, we've split the atom, we've spliced\nthe gene,\nand we've roamed Tranquility Base. We've reached for the stars, and never\nhave we\nbeen closer to having them in our grasp. New science, new technology is\nmaking the\ndifference between life and death, and so we need a national commitment\nequal to this\nunparalleled moment of possibility. And so, I announce to you tonight,\nthat I will\nbring the full resources of the federal government and the full reach of my\noffice\nto this fundamental goal: we will cure cancer by the end of this decade.\"\n\nLISA\n[pause] That was nice. [beat] I'll pass the notes along.\n\nSam nods and watches Lisa leave his office. As he leans back on his chair,\nwe see his\ncomputer screen and the words to his draft. With a touch, he highlights all\nthe words,\nbefore he deletes them. For a moment, Sam just sits still, staring at the\nblank page.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

JOSH'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\n5:14 A.M.\nBZZT. The Intercom buzzes. Suddenly, in the dark, Josh sits up in bed,\nmoaning and\ngroaning, just getting up from sleep. BZZT. The Intercom buzzes again. Someone\nis\noutside. Josh gets up, turns a light on, and lets the visitor in. He picks\nup a remote\ncontrol on a table and turns the television on in his living room.\n\nNEWSCASTER 1\nThe Supreme Court has issued its annual report. Details in this report...\n\nJosh turns on a second television, set on another channel, in his kitchen. Then\nhe\nturns to his coffee maker and opens the top. He slowly picks up the coffee\nground from\nyesterday and throws it in the trash.\n\nNEWSCASTER 2\nVoters in Iowa will pass the first ballots as the Presidential primary season\nofficially\ngets underway. President Bartlet, unchallenged in the Democratic caucus is\nflying to\nCedar Rapids today. While on the Republican side, Governor Ritchie looks to\nbe the\nfront-runner in the primaries. The official campaign season begins today in\nIowa...\n\nJosh opens his refrigerator and reaches for a coffee can. Finding it empty,\nhe almost\nputs it back.\n\nJOSH\nWhy would I put it back?\n\nHe goes back to his trashcan and picks up the coffee ground he just threw\naway and puts\nit back in the coffee maker.\n\nNEWSCASTER 2\nThere will be only one candidate in the kickoff... President Jed\nBartlet. President\nBartlet is the first Democratic incumbent since Franklin Roosevelt to go\nunchallenged\nby his own party. With no opposition, he could easily bypass the Iowa caucus.\n\nSomeone knocks on the door. Josh goes to answer.\n\nNEWSCASTER 2 [CONT.]\nThe President feels that in the spirit of democracy, he must present\nhimself...\n\nThe knocking continues.\n\nNEWSCASTER 2 [CONT.]\n...to the American people as the candidate...\n\nJosh opens the door for his early morning visitor. It's Amy.\n\nAMY\nHello.\n\nJOSH\nHello.\n\nAmy walks in and makes herself comfortable. She puts down her purse, takes\noff her coat\nand gets a glass of water in the kitchen.\n\nAMY\nYou let anybody up without asking who it is?\n\nJOSH\nI thought you were breakfast.\n\nAMY\nYou know what?\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nAMY\nJohn's never asked to see the WLC's high donor database.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nAMY\nHe's never asked to see the high donor database or any other mailing\nlist... so, how do\nyou like them apples?\n\nJOSH\nI just went to sleep about two hours ago.\n\nAMY\nYou think he's using me.\n\nJOSH\nIs the sun even up?\n\nAMY\nI just thought you should know.\n\nJOSH\nNo, not so much.\n\nAMY\nThose pajamas are too big for you.\n\nJOSH\nWhat makes you say that?\n\nAMY\nWell, you've got the bottoms all...\n\nJOSH\nI know it's too big for me. What are you doing here?\n\nAMY\nDemonstrating, once and for all, that John's not using me to get the women's\nvote.\n\nJOSH\nYou're flaky. You know that? You're quite the flake.\n\nAMY\nNot once has he asked to see the database...\n\nJOSH\nI was done with this fight a month ago.\n\nAMY\n...Never asked us to sponsor a fundraiser for him.\n\nJOSH\nIt's early.\n\nAMY\nIt's January. You think it's too early to start raising money?\n\nJOSH\nNo, I'm saying it's 5:00 in the morning.\n\nAMY\nI offered him a slot to speak on Safe Haven Laws; he declined. He hardly\ntakes photo-ops\nwith me.\n\nJOSH\nHe always takes photo-ops with you.\n\nAMY\n[beat] Yes. Yes, he does, but he never runs them in his Congressional\nnewsletter... How\ndo you like them apples?\n\nJOSH\nWe're gonna stop with the apples soon, right?\n\nAMY\nAdmit that you're wrong, and that his relationship with me has nothing to\ndo with\npolitics.\n\nJOSH\n[walks to his kitchen] I admit it.\n\nAMY\n[follows him] You mean it?\n\nJOSH\nNo, of course, I'm right.

It's Leo. He is busy\nwriting\nsomething on his desk. Margaret is there with him, listening to Josh on the\nspeaker.\n\nJOSH [CONT.]\n...and sang 'Honky Tonk Woman.' Time number four involved a variety of\nhosiery...\n\nLEO\nJosh, I'm gonna stop you right here, okay?\n\nJOSH\nLeo?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nAnybody else in the office?\n\nMARGARET\nHey, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nHey, Margaret.\n\nLEO\nWe've got a problem in Vieques and a caucus in Iowa.

'Cause we're coming\nback at\n8:00 and I don't get tired at 8:00, plus I won't be the one flying the\nplane... Oh, my\nGod. Dad, 'cause this is how it is. If it's in the 48 states, we come back\nthe same day.\nThe taxpayers paid for a very comfortable and fast airplane, and this is\nwhat they had in\nmind when they did... Am I gonna... No... Because I don't live in Iowa,\nand I'm not\nallowed to vote there... Ah, see. There's always a catch... Well, he's\nunchallenged in\nthe Iowa caucus, so I like our chances... No, Dad.

C.J. gets up and walks.\n\nPILOT [on P.A.]\nMr. President, ladies and gentlemen, good morning from the flight deck. This\nis\nLieutenant Colonel Gantry. We're passing through some turbulence on our way\nto a\ncruising altitude of 41,000 feet. Our flight plan this morning...\n\nThe plane encounters a little turbulence as the lights flicker.

[looks at his watch] You're not\nat your\ncruising altitude yet, so I'm gonna say an average of 400 knots with a light\nheadwind,\nbut I'm gonna go ahead and guess Cumberland, West Virginia. Am I right?\n\nTOBY\nI have no idea.\n\nSAM\nWell, then we'll say I'm right.

So some 40 protesters have planted themselves in a live\ntarget range.\n\nJOSH\nI don't-I'm sorry. Why am I...? This is national security.\n\nLEO\nOne of the protesters, in fact, the leader, apparently, is a friend of yours.\n\nJOSH\nBilly.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\n[pause] Arrest them. It's what he's waiting for you to do.\n\nLEO\nThis is a well-known actor. This well-loved young man in the Hispanic\ncommunity.

It's what's\ncalled 'non\npoint source pollution.'\n\nThe reporters clamor for questions.\n\nBARTLET [on T.V.]\nYeah, over here.

Well, the lawyers are gonna ask you some general questions, and...\n\nDONNA\nFor instance?\n\nSAM\nDo you know any reason why you can't render an impartial verdict?\n\nDONNA\nI hate criminals.\n\nSAM\nDo you have any prejudices or feelings that might influence the jury in\nrendering a\nverdict?\n\nDONNA\nI hate criminals, and I'm assuming if you're in this courtroom, you did\nsomething wrong,\nso...\n\nSAM\nYeah.

You remember that UFO you were tracking over\nMaui? Turned out\nto be an abandoned Russian satellite. One of its rockets didn't fire, so it\ncouldn't\nreenter.\n\nBOB\nSo you would have us believe.\n\nSAM\nNo, really.\n\nBOB\nYes, of course.\n\nSAM\n[pause] Why don't we get to it, Bob?\n\nBOB\nAbsolutely, Sam. On behalf of two different Congressmen, I would like\npermission to tour\nthe U.S. Bullion Depository.\n\nSAM\nWhere is that?\n\nBOB\nFort Knox, Kentucky.\n\nSAM\nTalk to the Treasury Department.\n\nBOB\nWe have, and not at all surprisingly, they've said no.\n\nSAM\nWhy do you want to tour Fort Knox?\n\nBOB\nIt was brought to our attention that of the 8500 metric tons of gold that\nare stored\nthere, only 1000 remain.\n\nSAM\nReally?\n\nBOB\nYes, sir.\n\nSAM\nWho brought it to your attention?\n\nBOB\nLet's just say a friend of ours.\n\nSAM\n[beat] A human friend, or...?\n\nBOB\nSam, I know what you think of me and the work I do. I've lived with this\nattitude my\nwhole life. My father lived with it, too. I'm seeking a Presidential order\nfor the\ndepository to be audited.\n\nSAM\nWell, I'll pass that along.\n\nBOB\nI'm sure you will.\n\nSAM\nBob...\n\nBOB\nHas the President ever toured the vault?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nBOB\nNo. Only two Presidents have: Roosevelt and Truman.\n\nSAM\nYou think there's something funny going on?\n\nBOB\nI, and two Congressmen think the gold has been replaced.\n\nSAM\nWith what?\n\nSilence. Sam couldn't help but listen.\n\nSAM\nI won't get sucked into this.\n\nBOB\nSam...\n\nSAM\nI won't get sucked into this.\n\nBOB\nThe Papoose Lake Spacecraft...\n\nSAM\nThere's no such thing.\n\nBOB\n...taken from Roswell to Groom Lake in 1947. A little piece of land called\nArea 51, my\nfriend.\n\nSAM\nThis is like Dungeons and Dragons camp all over again. We tested U-2 planes\nin Area 51.\n\nBOB\nWhich is why, in '57, they had to take Papoose to Fort Knox.\n\nSAM\nI've got news for you. Ten years ago, the Secretary of the Air Force concluded\nan\nexhausted search of records.\n\nBOB\nOh, I read it, and my father read it, and the report concluded that the\nactivities in the\ndesert was balloon research.\n\nSAM\nIt was balloon research.\n\nBOB\nA crew was retrieved.\n\nSAM\nThey were anthropomorphic dummies.\n\nBOB\nSam, patronize me, laugh at my work, but please don't minimize the lifetime\nmy father\nspent in this pursuit. The man had three Ph.D.s. There were bodies at Roswell\nArmy\nAirfield Hospital.\n\nOutside, Josh knocks at the door. Sam gets up.\n\nSAM\nExcuse me. [stops just short of the door and turns to look at Bob]\nWhen did your dad pass away?\n\nBOB\nPardon?\n\nSAM\nWhen did he pass away?\n\nBOB\nThree months ago.\n\nSAM\nExcuse me.\n\nSam exits and faces Josh.\n\nJOSH\nListen...\n\nSAM\nI'm sorry, but I'm in there with this guy. You wouldn't believe it. He\ninsists the\ngovernment is concealing evidence of extraterrestrial contact, and we've\ngot it at\nFort Knox.\n\nNot sure how to reply, Josh changes the subject.\n\nJOSH\nWe were able to make a deal with Billy. They'll pull off the island right\naway. In\nexchange, we meet with a delegation, political affairs, Navy...\n\nSAM\nIt's not gonna look like we caved?\n\nJOSH\nWe'll be slapped by the right, but they're not gonna want to piss off the\nLatinos.\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nJOSH\nYou know what else? I'm going to Tahiti with Amy.\n\nSAM\nYou're kidding.\n\nJOSH\nDay after tomorrow. [beat] So this, this guy...\n\nSAM\nYeah, the thing is... he kind of inherited the family business.\n\nJOSH\nI-I gotta go online and buy Tahitian things.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nWhen Josh walks off, Sam goes back in.\n\nSAM\nBob?\n\nBOB\nYes?\n\nSAM\n[sits] I was just talking to... Let's just say I talked to an associate. This\nassociate\nhas higher clearance than I do.\n\nBOB\nAnd?\n\nSAM\nYou can keep pursuing this, and I imagine you will, but we can't give you\nthe proper\npaperwork you'll need to audit the vault. [beat] You understand?\n\nBOB\n[disgruntled] Oh, I think I understand.\n\nSAM\nDo you?\n\nBOB\nWink's as good as a nod to a blind man.\n\nSAM\nYeah... Listen. These two Congressmen, they're Democrats?\n\nBOB\n[pause] I'm not at liberty to say.\n\nSAM\nI understand. Thank you very much.\n\nBOB\nThank you, Sam.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Donna joins Josh as they walk to the BULLPEN AREA.\n\nDONNA\nListen.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nThe trick, obviously, is appearing unsuitable not just for this, but for\nany jury while\navoiding a contempt citation. So wouldn't you think if I just explain to\nthem that my\nboss is a lawyer, my lawyer's a lawyer, and I'm dating a lawyer, that that\nought to...\n\nJOSH\nIt's jury duty. It's not appendectomy. It's jury duty. Do it, don't do it,\nbut if you\ndon't do it, you don't get to complain about the O.J. verdict.\n\nHe leaves Donna by her desk.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

No. He's not. I want to stay.\n\nAMY\nOkay.\n\nJOSH\nFor one thing, it involves a friend of mine, and he did something he didn't\nwant to do,\nand... Look, I just want to make sure his back is covered.\n\nAMY\nLook, don't get angry at me.\n\nJOSH\nI'm not.\n\nAMY\nYou're getting preemptively angry with me, which assumes I'm other people,\nand frankly,\nI'd rather be a political asset, if you know what I mean.\n\nJOSH\nI do, and when you're done comparison-shopping, give me a call.\n\nAMY\nWell, I'd definitely be waiting by your phone, Josh. Take it easy.\n\nWhen Josh hangs up, Donna enters.\n\nDONNA\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nI don't know if you care, but you officially won the Iowa Democratic\nCaucus.

He said, 'Let's banish discrimination from our minds\nand hearts.'\nHow is affirmative action doing that?\n\nTOBY\nI'm talking about college admissions.\n\nC.J.\nI'm talking about my father.\n\nTOBY\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\n'Cause he's not doing fine.

And the butter Last Supper with the butter?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nSAM\n[to Toby] You know what the Bob Engler meeting turned out to be?\n\nTOBY\nThis is the UFO guy?\n\nSAM\nYeah. He thinks the government is keeping alien bodies at the Bullion\nDepository in Fort\nKnow. What are we keeping in the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox?\n\nC.J.\n[pause] Soup?\n\nSAM\nNo, seriously. There used to be 8500 metric tons of gold there, now most of\nthem's moved\nout.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nWhat's there now?\n\nTOBY\nI wouldn't ask a lot of questions, Sam.\n\nSAM\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTOBY\nDon't worry about it.\n\nSAM\nOkay.

[invites her in] Something's wrong with the lights. Let\nme feel\naround for a switch here.\n\nAll of a sudden, Josh switches the light on. The room is now decorated with\ncolorful\nlights and other Tahitian ornaments. At the same time, music is played. Amy\nlooks around,\namazed at the view.\n\nSINGER\nRed, red wine\nGoes to my head\nMakes me forget that I...\n\nAMY\nYou did this?\n\nJOSH\nA little piece of Tahiti right here in Georgetown. Would you like a Samoan\nFog Cutter\nor a Navy Grog? A Samoan Fog Cutter has three kinds of rum, including Bacardi\n451 and...\n[Amy plays with his ear] the difference between that and a Navy Grog is...\n\nAMY\nDid you ask me over to exchange recipes?\n\nJosh puts red lei around Amy's neck.\n\nAMY\nShould I change?\n\nJOSH\nInto what?\n\nAMY\nI remember a pair of big pajamas.\n\nJOSH\n[smiles] Yeah. Good thinking.\n\nAMY\nYou can turn on the news, you know.\n\nJOSH\nI don't want to turn on the news.\n\nAMY\nJust to see how they're covering Iowa.\n\nAmy pushes a button on the remote control and turns the TV on...\n\nNEWSCASTER\n...by 12 points...\n\nBut Josh snatches it and turns the TV off.\n\nSINGER\nRed, red wine\nStay close to me\nDon't let me be alone...\n\nAs Josh and Amy get comfortably close, Josh leans in to kiss her.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: INT.

Toby walks in.\n\nTOBY\nGood evening sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI thought you'd gone home.\n\nTOBY\nI was just watching some of the coverage.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's gonna be Ritchie.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nI mean it's gonna be Ritchie.\n\nTOBY\nI know.\n\nBARTLET\nIt would have been, I don't know, it would have seemed obnoxious. It would've\nseemed\nlike grandstanding. [beat] You want some bourbon?\n\nTOBY\nThank you, sir.\n\nBARTLET\n[stands to get the drinks] What do you think?\n\nTOBY\nI was a telemarketer for about a week. I can't remember what we were selling,\nbut you\nworked off a script. 'Hi. Good evening. My name is...' And 'Toby Ziegler'\nwas okay for\nNew York, but once I got into the other time zones, I needed a name. I wasn't\ngonna\nbother anybody.\n\nBARTLET\nToby, if you have something to say, please say it.\n\nHe offers Toby the bourbon, which he takes.\n\nTOBY\nRitchie's good for all time zones.\n\nBARTLET\n[sits] My family signed the Declaration of Independence. You think I've got\nan ethnicity\nproblem?\n\nTOBY\nWell, the line isn't between light skin and dark skin.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nTOBY\n[sits] It's between educated and masculine... or Eastern Academic Elite and\nPlain-Spoken.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's always been like that.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, but a funny thing happened when the White House got demystified. The\nimpression\nwas left that anybody could do it.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're not telling me anything I don't know.\n\nTOBY\nIt's one thing that Ritchie came out for the Pennsylvania Referendum today,\nbut the\nmanner in which he articulated it. His presence, the clear sign he wasn't\npersonally\nengaged with the facts.\n\nBARTLET\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nHis staff was cringing, I promise you, and we let it go.\n\nBARTLET\nIt wasn't the moment to go.\n\nTOBY\nYou were asked the question.\n\nBARTLET\n[pause] Do you have anything else?\n\nTOBY\n[sighs] Sir, I don't think I need to tell you that the level of respect with\nwhich the\nstaff speaks of you doesn't change, depending on whether or not you're in\nthe room.\n\nBARTLET\nBut?\n\nTOBY\nWell, there's always been a concern... about the two Bartlets. [beat] The\nabsent-minded\nprofessor with the 'Aw, Dad' sense of humor. Disarming and unthreatening. Good\nfor all\ntime zones. And the Nobel Laureate. Still searching for salvation. Lonely,\nfrustrated.\nLethal.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're gonna sing a country western song?\n\nTOBY\nThe one whose father never liked him because he was too smart.\n\nBARTLET\n[stands] This stopped being fun for me a little while ago.\n\nTOBY\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nIt was actually never fun for me. I was just being polite.\n\nHe goes back to the side to refill his drink.\n\nTOBY\n[pause] Your father used to hit you, didn't he, Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\n[with back turned] Excuse me?\n\nTOBY\nYour father used to hit you, sir?\n\nThe President turns around slowly.\n\nBARTLET\n[pause] Yeah.\n\nTOBY\nNot like a spanking.\n\nBARTLET\nHe hit me. Why?\n\nTOBY\nHe punched you.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm done being polite now.\n\nTOBY\nHe did it because you made him mad, but you didn't know why.\n\nBARTLET\nToby, it was a complicated relationship. Can I help you?\n\nTOBY\nIt was because you were smarter than he was.\n\nBARTLET\nIt was a complicated relationship.\n\nTOBY\nHe didn't like you, sir. That's why he hit you. That's why people hit each\nother.\nHe didn't like you. You were smarter than he was.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy are we talking about this?\n\nTOBY\nSo maybe if you get enough votes, win one more election, maybe your father\nwill--\n\nBARTLET\nYou have stepped WAY over the line, and any other President would have your\nass on the\nsidewalk right now.\n\nTOBY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThey would've had you on the sidewalk a long time ago. [firmly] I don't know\nwhat the\nhell goes on in a Brooklyn shrink's office, but get it the hell out of my\nhouse!\n\nToby is silenced. It might have been too much.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nHe quietly leaves. In the Outer Office, a television is on.\n\nNEWSCASTER [on T.V.]\n...unchallenged by his own party. With no opposition, he could easily bypass\nthe Iowa\nCaucus, but according to a White House spokesman...\n\nToby stops to turn the TV off. In the Oval Office, Bartlet sits down, deep\nin thought.\nAmidst the silence, a clock is ticking.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

AINSLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nSam enters through the double doors behind her while Ainsley sits at the desk,\nconsulting\nseveral books. She is now dressed in ordinary office clothes.\n\nSAM\nWhat do you need?\n\nAINSLEY\nThere's a thing in this we need to be careful of.\n\nSAM\nWhat?\n\nAINSLEY\nThey say they'll approve a new scale of peacekeeping assessments if there's\na cost-sharing\nmechanism, but it isn't fully addressed here. You're gonna want me to rewrite\nsome of this\nlanguage before the president goes to the U.N..\n\nSAM\n[thoughtfully] Mm.\n\nAINSLEY\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nLet me ask you something. Before, when I said that you were enough to make\na good dog\nbreak his leash, you understand that men, we're the dog, right? I was the dog?\n\nAINSLEY\nI understood the metaphor.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nAINSLEY\nThe peacekeeping assessment has to be based on per capita income of each\ncountry, with\ncategory J countries paying the least at a ninety percent discount.\n\nSAM\nI meant it to make you feel good.\n\nAINSLEY\nIt did.\n\nSAM\nAlthough I certainly meant it.\n\nAINSLEY\nI appreciate it.\n\nSAM\nI didn't mean to demean you.\n\nAINSLEY\nI kind of need you to listen along.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nAINSLEY\nCategory A countries will be paying a premium, actually over-paying to cover\nthe discounts\nfor category J states.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nAINSLEY\nSo we need to be more specific about Category A. It's gonna be important.\n\nSAM\nI was told that I demeaned you.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou didn't.\n\nSAM\nI was told that I did.\n\nAINSLEY\nBy whom?\n\nSAM\nBy someone named Celia.\n\nAINSLEY\nShe's mistaken.\n\nSAM\nYou sure?\n\nAINSLEY\nIf I felt demeaned, I'd be among the very first people to know it.\n\nSAM\nTerrific.\n\nAINSLEY\nHere are my notes.\n\nSAM\nI'll rewrite them now.

TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nANDY\nAmerica doesn't have a monopoly on what's right. And even if we did, I think\nyou're gonna\nhave a tough time convincing the Arab world.\n\nTOBY\nWell, we'd like to talk to them about it.\n\nANDY\nThat ought to do the trick.\n\nTOBY\nIt's worth a shot.\n\nANDY\nThe U.S. Constitution defends religious pluralism. It doesn't reduce all of\nIslam to\nfanaticism.\n\nTOBY\nNeither foes the speech. It calls fanaticism fanaticism.\n\nANDY\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nIt's fanaticism whether we call it that or not, so were going to call it\nthat. We respect\nall religions, all cultures.\n\nANDY\nTo a point.\n\nTOBY\nYes, to a point. Grotesque oppression isn't okay just because it's been\ninstitutionlised.\nIf you ask me, I think we should have gotten into the game three, four\ndecades ago, but\nthey're coming after us now, so it's time to saddle up.\n\nANDY\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nWe do know what's right.\n\nANDY\nThis is why they hate us.\n\nTOBY\nThere's a lot of reasons why they hate us. You know when they're gonna like\nus? When we win.\n\nHe leans back against the wall.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE- NIGHT\nWallace and Bill Price's wife, JANET, stand waiting.

PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nSTANLEY\nInsomnia's a pretty common symptom of depression. Are you depressed?\n\nStanley is still seated whilst Bartlet pours himself a drink.\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nSTANLEY\nI didn't think so. Some people or predisposed to insomnia in times of acute\nstress.\nAre you under any stress? Is there any stress in your... job at all,\nor...? [beat]\nBut seriously folks, has there been an unusual amount of stress lately?\n\nBARTLET\nWell, Congress was investigating me.\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd I was censured. Then I had to give the State of the Union.\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm running for reelection.\n\nSTANLEY\nMh-hmm.\n\nBARTLET\nThings are blowing up everywhere, and I have chosen the General Assembly of\nthe U.N.\nto define a tougher foreign policy. Not unusually stressful, no.\n\nHe swigs his drink, then sets it down and returns to his seat.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't like the word \"stress\". It's a Madison Avenue word. It's something\nthat can be\ncured with flavored coffee and bath bubbles.\n\nSTANLEY\nSo, you don't feel stress?\n\nBARTLET\nI have a job I like, and my family's healthy.\n\nSTANLEY\nThat doesn't mean you're not entitled to feel stress.\n\nBARTLET\nStress is for other people.\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat other people?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm saying it's not stress. I was feeling stressed five nights ago, too and\nI slept fine.\n\nSTANLEY\nSo what happened four nights ago?\n\nBARTLET\nI want my money back.\n\nSTANLEY\n[after a moment] This is a very unusual conversation.\n\nBARTLET\nI get that a lot.\n\nSTANLEY\nI'd imagine.\n\nBARTLET\nSo, what do you charge?\n\nSTANLEY\nThree hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour.\n\nBARTLET\nFor three hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour, you ought to bring your\nown damn\nlingerie.\n\nSTANLEY\nI do.\n\nBARTLET\nThere's a great story about Arthur Miller. \"Death of a Salesman\" had just\nopened on\nBroadway the night before, and he was walking around his old neighborhood\nin Brooklyn\nand he see's a hot dog vendor that he went to high school with, and he says,\n\"Hey, Jimmy,\nit's me, Arthur Miller.\" And the hot dog vendor says, \"Artie, how you\ndoing? What you\nbeen up to?\" And Miller says, \"I'm, you know, I'm a playwright.\" And the\nhot dog vendor\nsays, \"Hmm, play writing, I should've gone into that.\" Three hundred and\nseventy-five\ndollars an hour.\n\nSTANLEY\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nFor what?\n\nSTANLEY\nI don't really know.\n\nBartlet lays his head back and sighs.\n\nBARTLET\nI can't sleep. I can't sleep. I'll be tired and I'll lie there and it doesn't\nhappen.\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat happened four nights ago?\n\nBARTLET\nI won the Iowa Caucus.\n\nSTANLEY\nAnything else?\n\nBARTLET\nThat's not enough?\n\nSTANLEY\nMr. President... If you were any other patient-\n\nBARTLET\nSay what you'd say to anyother patient.\n\nSTANLEY\nI'd say, screw around if you want, but it's your money, it's about to be my\nmoney, and\nI sleep fine.\n\nBARTLET\n[sitting up] I had a conversation with one of m aides that night after we\ngot back from\nIowa. He called me on something.\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat?\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I guess we talked about a lot of things. Who we think the Republican\nchallenger is\ngonna be be, and imcumbency and campaign stategy, strategic overview, but\nthe long and\nshort of it is, my father never liked me at all.\n\nThere is a long silence.\n\nSTANLEY\nWell, at least we're closer to my area now.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I'd thought you'd enjoy that.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT.

I don't know what's happening to my life.\n\nSAM\nListen, I can tell you're down in the dumps, but let's talk about me.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nIf your sister was getting ready for a night out, and I said, \"Deanna,\nyou're enough to\nmake a good dog break his leash,\" would you think I was a cad?\n\nCHARLIE\nI'd think you were a hick.\n\nAINSLEY\n[approaching] Sam...\n\nSAM\nHang on. Because of the sentiment or the expression?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's my sister?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'd beat you up.\n\nSAM\nYou and how many Girl Scouts?\n\nCHARLIE\nIf I could stand up...\n\nAINSLEY\nSam...\n\nSAM\nBut if it wasn't your sister?\n\nCHARLIE\nThen you're fine.\n\nSAM\n[to Ainsley] He says I'm fine.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou're not, 'cause this isn't quite right.\n\nSAM\nStill?\n\nAINSLEY\nIt needs to be clear that the total assessment is down to 25 percent from\n27 percent for\nCategory A.\n\nSAM\nWe've been in this fight.\n\nCelia enters the bullpen.\n\nAINSLEY\nBut if we pay before...\n\nSAM\nHang on. Here she is. Celia, I asked Ainsley and she said she didn't mind\nat all.\nPlus, Charlie said he's fine with it.\n\nCELIA\nCharlie's a man.\n\nCHARLIE\nDamn right.\n\nCelia heads for her desk. Bonnie and Ginger both return.\n\nAINSLEY\nSam?\n\nSAM\nYes?\n\nAINSLEY\nWe need to be clear we are not going to take a bath when other countries\ncan afford to\ntake on more.\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nAINSLEY\nThis is important.\n\nSAM\nYeah, I also thinks it's important to make clear I am not a sexist.\n\nCHARLIE\nAnd that I'm all man.\n\nAINSLEY\nYou're Celia?\n\nCELIA\n[looking up] Yes.\n\nAINSLEY\nHe's not a sexist.\n\nShe turns back to Sam to continue the argument.\n\nCELIA\nIf you're willing to let your sexuality diminish your power.\n\nAINSLEY\nI'm sorry?\n\nCELIA\nI said, I'm surprised you're willing to let you sexuality diminish your power.\n\nAINSLEY\nI don't even know what that means.\n\nCELIA\nI think you do.\n\nAINSLEY\nAnd I think you think I'm made out of candy glass, Celia. If somebody says\nsomething\nthat offends you, tell them, but all women don't have to think alike.\n\nCELIA\nI didn't say they did, and when somebody said something that offended me,\nI did say so.\n\nAINSLEY\nI like it when the guys tease me. It's an inadvertent show of respect that\nI'm on the\nteam and I don't mind it when it gets sexual. And you know why? I like sex.\n\nCHARLIE\n[surprised] Hello.\n\nAINSLEY\nI don't think that whatever sexuality I may have diminishes my power. I\nthink it enhances it.\n\nCELIA\nAnd what kind of feminism do you call that?\n\nAINSLEY\nMy kind.\n\nGINGER\n[from over her shoulder] It's called Lipstick Feminism. I call it Stiletto\nFeminism.\n\nSAM\n[intrigued] Stilettos?\n\nAINSLEY\nYou're not in enough trouble already?\n\nSAM\nI suppose I am.\n\nCELIA\nIsn't the point that Sam wouldn't have been able to find another way to be\nchummy with\na woman who wasn't sexually appealing?\n\nAINSLEY\nHe would be able to, but that isn't the point. The point is that sexual\nrevolution tends\nto get in the way of actual revolution. Nonsense issues distract attention\naway from real\nones: pay equity, child care, honest-to-God sexual harrassment and in this\ncase, a speech\nin front of the U.N. General Assembly. So, you, [to Sam] 25 percent on the\nassesments for\nCategory A. You... [Charlie looks up.] I don't know what your thing is. [turns\nto Celia]\nAnd you, stop trying to take the fun out of my day. With that, I'm going to\nget a cupcake.\n\nSAM\n[after a moment] Well, for the moment at least, I'm going to do what she's\ntelling me to do.\n\nHe heads towards his office.\n\nGINGER\nWe're at O.E.O.B.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nBonnie wanders off somewhere.

She takes them in to C.J.'s office where\nJanet is waiting.\n\nDONNA\nThere.

And her brother Harry is three. Three and a quarter. He'd\nwant me to\nsay that. [beat] How does it work with the money, do you know?\n\nDONNA\nI don't. I'm an assistant here.\n\nJANET\nBill's written... I know he's written negetive things about the President...\n\nDONNA\n[shaking her head] No.\n\nJANET\nAnd he and C.J. don't really...\n\nDONNA\nNobody cares about that tonight.\n\nJANET\nOkay.\n\nDONNA\nAnd you want to know a secret about C.J.? But you can't tell your husband\nthis, really.\nShe battles with them everyday, but she loves reporters. She's very protective\nof them\nand it, it doesn't matter whether... you know?\n\nJanet nods, and reaches forward to pick up her coffee cup.\n\nCUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nTOBY [VO]\nIt took...\n\nANDY [VO]\nWait.\n\nTOBY\nIt took... Andrea, it took three days to get the language through NSC and\nthe NSA.\n\nANDY [VO]\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nIt isn't coming out of the speech.\n\nANDY\nI didn't think it was.\n\nTOBY\nThen why were we here for an hour?\n\nANDY\nSeveral members have drafted an insert. Will you look at?\n\nTOBY\n[after a beat] Sure.\n\nShe goes over to her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper.\n\nANDY\nThis will follow your paragraph.\n\nHe comes over to read it from her.\n\nTOBY\n[reading] \"Our goal is neither to preach nor proclaim American values. We\nhave deep\nrespect for our Islamic brothers and sisters and we have a great deal to\nlearn from\nthe values of... tolerence and faith that are deeply held throughout the\nIslamic world.\"\nSo this is your way of saying any resemblance the previous paragraph may\nhave had to\nforeign policy is purely coincidental?\n\nANDY\nThat's right.\n\nTOBY\nGuess what?\n\nANDY\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nOur goal is to proclaim American values.\n\nANDY\nThis speech isn't supposed to be about ideology. It's supposed to be about\nreality.\n\nTOBY\nI think the President will decide what the speech is suppose to be about,\nbut the\nreality is, the United States of America no longer sucks up to reactionaries,\nand\nour staunch allies will know what we mean.\n\nANDY\nWe don't have any staunch allies in the Arab world; just reluctant ones. We've\na\ncoalition held together with duct tape! A coalition without which we cannot\nfight!\n\nTOBY\nNobody's blowing off the coalition, and that coalition will be plenty strong.\n\nANDY\nOh, when we win?\n\nTOBY\nThat's right.\n\nANDY\nWhat's Egypt going to think? Or Pakistan?\n\nTOBY\nThat freedom and democracy are coming soon to a theatre near them, so get\ndressed.\n\nHe sits on the edge of his desk.\n\nANDY\nToby... you guys are on a thing right now. And I'm behind you. You know I'm\nbehind you;\na lot of House Democrats are...\n\nTOBY\nNot enough.\n\nANDY\nAnd plenty of Republicans. But this one moment in time, you have to get off\nyour horse\nand just... simply put - be nice to the Arab world.\n\nTOBY\nBe nice?\n\nANDY\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nWell... How about when we, instead of blowing Iraq back to the seventh\ncentury for\nharbouring terrorists and trying to develop nuclear weapons, we just imposed\neconomic\nsanctions and were reviled by the Arab world for not giving them a global\ncharge card\nand a free trade treaty? How about when we pushed Israel to give up land\nfor peace?\n\nAndy sits down, and puts a hand to her forehead.\n\nTOBY\nHow about when we sent American soldiers to protect Saudi Arabia, and the\nArab world\ntold us we were desecrating their holy land? We'll ignore the fact that we\nwere invited.\nHow about two weeks ago, in the State of the Union when the President praised\nthe Islamic\npeople as faithful and hardworking only to be denounced in the Arab press\nas knowing\nnothing about Islam? But none of that is the point.\n\nANDY\nWhat's the point?\n\nTOBY\nI don't remember having to explain to Italians that our problem wasn't with\nthem, but\nwith Mussolini! Why does the U.S. have to take every Arab country out for\nan ice cream\ncone? They'll like us when we win!\n\nHe stands up and starts pacing.\n\nTOBY\nThousands of madrassahs teaching children nothing, nothing, nothing but the\nKoran and to\nhate America. Who do we see about that? [beat] Do I want to preach America?\nJudeo-Christianity? No. If their religion forbids them from playing the\ntrumpet, so be it.\nBut I want those kids to... look at a globe. Be exposed to social sciences,\nhistory.\nSome literature. [beat] I'll like us when we win.\n\nANDY\n[after a moment] Okay.\n\nShe stands up and collects her things together.\n\nTOBY\nLet me take another look at the softer language.\n\nAndy takes it out of her bag and hands it to him, then leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\nDonna walks along, and C.J. and Wallace meet her.\n\nWALLACE\nHow's she doing?\n\nDONNA\nShe was asking how the money works... I didn't know.\n\nC.J.\nIt's not money, actually, it's a promise to honor international sanctions\nagainst the\nexport of something called \"Col-Tan\" by the Rwandan Army.\n\nDONNA\nWhat's Col-Tan?\n\nC.J.\nIt's a mineral they have a lot of in Congo. When you refine it, it's a\nnecessary component\nof cell phones and pagers, and the Rwandans and Ugandans smuggle it illegally.\n\nJosh approaches the three of them.\n\nJOSH\nListen.\n\nWALLACE\nWhat do you know?\n\nJOSH\nAkin Wamba, who's the Maimai rebel commander, sent word through a crew that\nwas filming\nin Goma.\n\nC.J.\n[lowering her head] Oh, God.\n\nJOSH\nYeah. He was killed in an ambush. Embassy Kinshasa's going to get the body.\n\nC.J. and Wallace walk into her office as Josh turns and heads back where he\ncame from.\nDonna watches through the doorway as they break the news.\n\nJANET\nNo, please... No! No. Oh, no. Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, God, no...\n\nDonna turns and looks up the corridor to where Josh stands watching her.

PRESIDENTS PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT\n\nSTANLEY [VO]\nIt can't be easy being you.\n\nThe camera pans around to where Bartlet sits opposite Stanley.\n\nBARTLET\nI told you...\n\nSTANLEY [VO]\nI don't mean the job. I meant, uh, you know, being inside your head.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's wrong with my head?\n\nSTANLEY\nI don't know.\n\nBARTLET\nOf course not. That would be three hundred and eighty-five dollars an hour.\n\nSTANLEY\nThey keep moving the goalpost on you, don't they? Get A's, good college,\nLatin honours.\nGet into the London School of Economics. Get a good teaching job. Ivy League\nschool,\ntenure. Now you gotta publish, now you gotta go to Stockholm.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not good for a person to keep setting goals?\n\nSTANLEY\nIt probably is, but it's tricky for somebody who's still trying to get his\nfather to\nstop hitting him.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I'm told that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah, but that's most men. That's not you. That's the other people, the ones\nwho feel\nstress. You're destined for something else.\n\nBARTLET\nI have abilities.\n\nSTANLEY\nAnd now you have an opportunity to use them.\n\nBARTLET\nI think I have.\n\nSTANLEY\nThat room I passed down the hall, on the left, it's got a name, right?\n\nBARTLET\nI think you're talking about the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\nSTANLEY\nRight. This is a hell of a curve you get graded on now. Lincoln freed the\nslaves and won\nthe Civil War. \"Thank you. Next! And what will you be singing for us today,\nMr. Bartlet?\"\n\"Well, we've had six straight quarters of economic growth.\"\n\nBARTLET\nThat's not easy.\n\nSTANLEY\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not easy.\n\nSTANLEY\nI believe you.\n\nBARTLET\nI think I've made tough choices.\n\nSTANLEY\nI think Lincoln did what he thought was right, even though it meant losing\nhalf the\ncountry. I think you don't do what you think is right if it means losing\nMichigan's\nelectoral votes.\n\nBARTLET\nYou don't know anything.\n\nSTANLEY\nI'll be the first to admit that.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm not trying to get my father to like me.\n\nSTANLEY\nGood. 'Cause it's never, never gonna happen. Look, we're done for the night.\n\nHe stands up and gets ready to leave.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nSTANLEY\n[glancing at his watch] We've been here for two hours. It was a double\nsession. We're\ndone for the night.\n\nBARTLET\nStanley, I hate to put it this way, but I'm me, and you're you, and we're\ndone when I\nsay we're done.\n\nSTANLEY\nNo. [beat] I think you could use some assistance right now, sir. Use me,\ndon't use me,\nbut all I can offer you is this: I'll be the only person in the world,\nother than your\nfamily, who doesn't care that you're the President. [beat] Our time is up.\n\nHe goes to the doors, opens them, and leaves. The agent outside closes them,\nleaving\nBartlet alone in the room. After a moment, he stands and walks over to his\ndesk, where\nhis cigarettes lie beneath a framed photo of his father. He lifts one out,\nlooks for a\nmoment at the painting of Lincoln on the far wall, then turns away and lights\nup.\nHe stands by the window, watching the storm.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

Especially when we know that\neducation can be a\nsilver bullet, it can be the silver bullet, Toby!

Abbey walks to him.\n\nABBEY\nDo you like these earrings?\n\nBARTLET\n[without looking] I do.\n\nABBEY\nYou want to look at them first?\n\nBARTLET\n[still not looking] Are they new?\n\nABBEY\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\n[still not looking] You've worn them?\n\nABBEY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\n[still into his puzzle] I love them. \"Laissez-faire doctrine.\" 15 letters.\n\nABBEY\n[walking away] Social Darwinism.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, that's not the answer. See, 'cause Social Darwinism isn't a doctrine. It's\na\nforce of nature.

Plus,\nit's your\nbirthday. You're old, and you don't move around that fast.\n\nABBEY\nLibertarianism has 14 letters not 15.\n\nBARTLET\nI know, so I'm shading in the extra box.

They're\ngonna give you\nthe very least they can give you.\n\nABBEY\nThey can't give me the very least they can give me.

Never mind. I'm just doing him a favor.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nHow you feeling about the First Lady?\n\nLEO\nI was feeling good, and now I'm not.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nWe're checking out, but I think the swing vote's gonna recuse himself. He's\na friend\nof the family.\n\nSAM\nThat means the President's gonna want to call him.\n\nLEO\nMaybe.\n\nSAM\nYeah, he can't.\n\nLEO\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nHe can't call him. It could send us into a whole new thing.\n\nLEO\nYou ever mix politics and the President's family and get a good result?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nLEO\nMe neither, and I've been a this a lot longer.\n\nSAM\nOkay.

There's no presence in Washington. It's just\nme on the\nAmtrak coming to see you. That's how seriously the government takes it.\n\nSAM\nWell, there was a time...\n\nMILLGATE\nI know.\n\nSAM\nCongress spent two billion.\n\nMILLGATE\nYeah, but all they did was clear the land and build the lab. We need the\nthing. Now,\nis he there?\n\nSAM\nThe senator?\n\nMILLGATE\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nMILLGATE\n'Cause you said he'd be there. You said he'd be at the party.\n\nSAM\nHe's there.\n\nMILLGATE\nGo talk to him. [sits]\n\nSAM\nOkay. I said I'd do this, but it's likely he's gonna say this is an\nunaffordable luxury.\n\nMILLGATE\nWe're losing the race for discovery, Sam. For discovery.

It's a 16 year old islay single malt.\n\nTOBY\nI know Lagavulin.\n\nMARBURY\nThey usually have it here.\n\nTOBY\nLet's go down the street. The guy keeps a bottle there.\n\nMARBURY\nOh.

Can you tell\nme how it died?\n\nENLOW\nI don't know.\n\nSAM\nForgive me, sir. You're ranking member of the authorizing subcommittee.

It's Dalton\nMillgate.\nNow who's blocking the damn Supercollider.\n\nENLOW\nTo guess would compromise the spirit of the anonymous hold.\n\nSAM\nTo tell me would compromise the spirit of autocratic obstructionism.\n\nENLOW\nWe're talking about the U.S. Senate, kid. We're the saucer that cools the\ncoffee.\n\nSAM\nAnd the drain that swallows it, sir.\n\nENLOW\nCheck around. I'm on record in favor of it.\n\nSAM\nThank God the hold's anonymous.

They put a piece of toast in your wine cup to improve the flavor.\n\nCHARLIE\nInteresting.\n\nBARTLET\n1643.

I'd like you to add these names.\n\nJOSH\nI can't help noticing these are all women.\n\nABBEY\nWomen are 60% of our vote, Josh.

Amy stands and starts to grab her\nown bottle\nand a glass.\n\nJOSH\nYou're going?\n\nAMY\nThe First Lady just asked me to get boozy with her.

The professor continues to puff smoke\nfor the cigar.\n\nSAM\nI need you to tell me everything you can tell me about the Superconducting\nSupercollider.\n\nMILLGATE\nHow much time do we have?\n\nSAM\nAbout ten minutes.\n\nMILLGATE\nIf you pay close attention, stay very, very quiet, I can teach you how to\nspell it.\n\nOut the dooble doors, they reach the PORTICO and stop walking.\n\nSAM\nListen. This is what I do. I get things fast.\n\nMILLGATE\nSince when?\n\nSAM\nWhat is it?\n\nMILLGATE\nIt's a machine that reveals the origin of matter, and I'm assuming from the\nlook on\nyour face $1000 on the table, you couldn't tell me what matter is.\n\nSAM\nYou know what? I had four years. There's a lot of knowledge out there. I\nmay have\nmissed some... things.\n\nMILLGATE\nBy smashing protons together at very high speeds and at very high temperatures,\nwe\ncan recreate the Big Bang in a laboratory setting, creating the kinds of\nparticles\nthat only existed in the first trillionth of a second after the universe\nwas created.\n\nSAM\nOkay, terrific. I understand that. What kind of practical applications does\nit have?\n\nMILLGATE\nNone at all.\n\nSAM\nYou're not in any way a helpful person.\n\nMILLGATE\nDon't have to be. I have tenure.\n\nSAM\nDoctor.\n\nMILLGATE\nThere are no practical applications, Sam. Anybody who says different is lying.\n\nSAM\nI need to be able to show him I can paint him against something. Children,\nbaseball,\ncampaign finance. What does it mean to be against the Supercollider?\n\nMILLGATE\nI really don't know where to start.\n\nSAM\nCome on.\n\nMILLGATE\nI really don't. Listen, what's your motivation?\n\nSAM\nWhat are you talking about? You called me and asked me...\n\nMILLGATE\nWell, you did me the favor, but now you're still going.\n\nSAM\n[pause] I have a history with this particular senator.\n\nMILLGATE\nOh, well, uh, that's a really stupid ass reason, Sam.\n\nSAM\nI like to win.\n\nMILLGATE\nSo this guy ate your Fruit Loops...?\n\nSAM\nWhat do you care?\n\nMILLGATE\nI don't.\n\nSAM\nWhat's your motivation?\n\nMILLGATE\nI'm a particle physicist.\n\nSAM\nNot suddenly. Why now?\n\nMILLGATE\nThe budget resolution has to be passed by April 15. That means the authorizing\nbill to\nSenate Appropriations has to go up mid-March. Now, you can shoehorn a road\nor a bridge\nat the last minute, but not $12 million for a Supercollider. Also... I have\nNon-Hodgkins\nLymphoma.\n\nSam is immediately surprised. Millgate paces and puffs smoke from his cigar.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BAR - NIGHT\nToby and Lord Marbury are seated by the counter. The bartender is pouring\ntheir drinks.\n\nTOBY\nI think there's something to be said for giving McGann credibility by inviting\nhim to\nthe White House. It strengthens his hand in-in dealing with the more violent\nmembers\nof the party.\n\nMARBURY\nDegrees of violent.\n\nTOBY\nWe also think if we legitimize him, the Protestants will wake up and accept\nthey've\ngot to negotiate with somebody.\n\nMARBURY\nToby, you were the author, were you not, of the President's speech at the\nGeneral\nAssembly?\n\nTOBY\nThere were many authors.\n\nMARBURY\nOf which you were one. Two days ago, the IRA formally backed out of its\npromise to put\nits weapons beyond use...\n\nTOBY\nI--\n\nMARBURY\n...as agreed to in the Good Friday Peace Accord. True/False: Until it disarms\nthe IRA and\nits political representatives in Sinn Fein are a terrorist group.\n\nTOBY\nTrue.\n\nMARBURY\nWhen did it become policy of the United States to negotiate with terrorists?\n\nTOBY\nWe've had Arafat here, John.\n\nMARBURY\nAnd, my heaven, isn't that paying bloody dividends.\n\nTOBY\nIt wasn't worth trying?\n\nMARBURY\nYou're making the mistake of youth.\n\nTOBY\nThe President's not a kid.\n\nMARBURY\nYour country is. You're involving yourself in a centuries-old conflict\nwithout sufficient\nregard for history. Listen to the warning of old friends. It was Kipling\nwho warned to\nexpect \"the blame of those ye better, and the hate of those ye guard.\"\n\nTOBY\nAnd wasn't it James Joyce who said, \"History is a nightmare from which I'm\ntrying to\nawake.\"\n\nMARBURY\nYes, but it was your own great Irish master, Eugene O'Neill who said,\n\"There is no\npresent or future, only the past happening over and over again -- now.\"\n\nTOBY\nYou're saying we should butt out of Ireland until we know what we're doing?\n\nMARBURY\nI'm saying Brendan McGann cannot come to the White House.\n\nTOBY\n[pause] Say, speaking of dead Irish writers...\n\nMARBURY\nYes. Another drink.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE/PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT\nIn a private room in the residence, Abbey, C.J. and Amy walk in with their\nbottles and\nglasses. The red room is elegantly decorated with paintings and fancy\nfurniture.\n\nABBEY\nHere we go. Awasiwi Odinak. Far from the things of man. When Jed first took\nme to his\nhouse, which was 25 miles from anywhere, he said, \"Awasiwi Odinak. Far from\nthe things\nof man.\" What a jackass.\n\nC.J.\nI'm gonna open the wine.\n\nABBEY\nThe wine...\n\nAfter gazing at the large painting on the wall, Amy tries to slowly open a\ndrawer below\nthe painting, making sure Abbey is not looking.\n\nABBEY\n...is a '95 Old Vine Zinfandel from Hog Cellars, which once belonged to King\nBaudouin of\nBelgium and is best sipped while making anagrams out of the phrase \"My\nhusband's an\nenourmous jackass.\"\n\nAbbey and C.J. sit. Abbey sees Amy taking a peek at the drawer.\n\nABBEY\nAmy, what are you looking for?\n\nAMY\nAnything I can takes notes with.\n\nAmy joins them to sit. C.J. starts to open a wine bottle with a corkscrew.\n\nC.J.\nThis is an excellent corkscrew. Just slides right in there like power\nsteering. The right\ntool for the job. [tries to take the cork off, but couldn't] This corkscrew\nsucks. Should\nI call the steward?\n\nABBEY\nNo need to call the steward. I'm Board certified in thoracic surgery. And\na good thing,\ntoo. [to Amy] Did Josh have a nutty on the campaign hiring?\n\nAMY\nHe's, you know, he's adjusting.\n\nABBEY\nWell, let him adjust faster. Jackass.\n\nDONNA\n[wanders in] Excuse me.\n\nABBEY\nOh, Donna.\n\nDONNA\nI'm sorry, ma'am. Josh was looking for Amy.\n\nABBEY\nWell, she's right here. Where have you been all night?\n\nDONNA\nWell, it's a little tough to explain, ma'am.\n\nABBEY\nTougher to explain than secretly prescribing Betaseron?\n\nDONNA\nIt turns out I'm not an American citizen, so Secret Service wanted me to\ntalk to INS.\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nDONNA\nI was born in Warroad, Minnesota, only I wasn't, 'cause INS just clarified\nthe border,\nand it's now in Manitoba.\n\nC.J.\nYou're not an American?\n\nDONNA\nMissed it by four miles.\n\nAMY\nYou seem pretty calm about it.\n\nDONNA\nNo, I'm very upset. I don't know the words to my national anthem. I've been\nthrowing out\nCanadian pennies my whole life. I've been making fun of the Queen. We don't\ndo that.\n\nABBEY\nI'm sure it'll all work out.\n\nDONNA\nThank you, ma'am. [turns to leave]\n\nABBEY\nWhere are you going?\n\nDONNA\nThey've let me into the party now.\n\nABBEY\nWhy don't you stay and have some wine with us?\n\nDONNA\nReally?\n\nABBEY\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nThat's very nice of you. [sits] I probably shouldn't drink though.\n\nC.J.\nI wouldn't worry about it.\n\nAMY\nCanadian, huh?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nAMY\nYou feel funnier?\n\nDONNA\nNo, but I am developing a massive inferiority complex.\n\nC.J.\n[struggling with the cork] Ah!\n\nABBEY\nDid it come out?\n\nC.J.\nNext best thing. It's in the bottle.\n\nABBEY\nWe'll decant it.\n\nAMY\nAh. Now it's a party.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. RESIDENCE/PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT\nAbbey, C.J., Amy and Donna are now on their second bottle of wine. They're\nall laughing.\n\nC.J.\nThis is a good bottle of wine. [laughs] Ah.

Graphite...\n\nABBEY\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nStop talking about the corkscrew?\n\nABBEY\nYeah.\n\nAMY\nMrs. Bartlet, I wanted to ask you a question, but I'm not sure how.\n\nABBEY\nWhat?\n\nAMY\nWell, if the most they can give you is a year's suspension, is it...?\n\nABBEY\nThat big a deal?\n\nAMY\nYes.\n\nABBEY\nYes. I'm a doctor. It's not like changing your major. You of all people\nshould... I mean\nwomen talk about their husbands overshadowing their careers. Mine got eaten.\n\nC.J.\nYour husband got eaten?\n\nABBEY\nMy career.\n\nC.J.\nYeah. Well, I'm on dangling modifier patrol.\n\nABBEY\nWhat's your problem?\n\nC.J.\nAre you First Lady right now?\n\nABBEY\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nC.J.\nSometimes you like to talk, and I think that's great, but sometimes you're\nAbbey, and\nsometimes you're my boss, and I respect both very much, but...\n\nABBEY\nI'm Abbey.\n\nC.J.\nYes. I agree with her. [points to Amy] Look, they take this job away from me,\nI got\nnothing. I don't have a cat. I could get one, but I don't have one. Frankly,\nI'm not\nwild about cats. I don't hate them. I'm just not... I could learn to like\nthem, I guess,\nif I...\n\nABBEY\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYou've got a husband, children, a home and a life. And we're talking about\none year of\nyour not having a medical license.\n\nABBEY\nJed got censured, and that came with no tangible penalty, and it was a banner\nheadline,\nand he's having a slow nervous breakdown.\n\nC.J.\nThat's different.\n\nABBEY\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nBecause it is, and you know it.\n\nABBEY\nOkay. I'm First Lady again.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nAMY\nYou're First Lady Abbey?\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nAMY\nAnd it's not like it's been a detour from health care.\n\nABBEY\nNo.\n\nAMY\nWhat? You've expanded Medicare to cover mammograms, cancer clinical\ntrials... That's\nmoney that could've gone to Viagra. You were the one that said \"no dice\"\nto cutting\ninfant nutrition programs, nursing home standards...\n\nC.J.\nThere's plenty of stuff left.\n\nAMY\n...child immunizations, juvenile diabetes...\n\nABBEY\nThat's not the point.\n\nAMY\nWhat's the point?\n\nABBEY\nI'm a doctor.\n\nDONNA\nOh, Mrs. Bartlet, for crying out loud, you were also a doctor when your\nhusband said,\n\"Give me the drugs, and don't tell anybody,\" and you said, \"Okay.\"\n\nAn uncomfortable silence fills the room. Everyone looks at Donna.\n\nDONNA\nOh, my God. You switched back to First Lady.\n\nABBEY\nThat's all right.\n\nDONNA\nI'm so sorry, Mrs. Bartlet.\n\nABBEY\nIt's okay.\n\nAMY\nHe took the censure standing up, Abbey.

In a MOVING\nSHOT on the\nfloor below, outside, to the PORTICO, Bartlet and Charlie are still preparing\nfor the\ntoast. Charlie is sitting on the bench, listening to Bartlet, who is pacing.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. Here we go.\n\nCHARLIE\nTime is tight.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's when the juices get flowing.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm not sure we have time for juices, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI could tell the story of the ditch digger.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nYou know the story?\n\nCHARLIE\nI do not.\n\nBARTLET\nAbbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said,\n\"Aren't you glad\nyou married me? You could've married a ditch digger.\" And she said, \"Jed,\nif I'd married\nhim, he'd be President.\" What do you think?\n\nCHARLIE\nNot so sure, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nCHARLIE\n'Cause it seems like a story about how cool you are.\n\nBARTLET\nIt is.\n\nCHARLIE\nDo you love her?\n\nBARTLET\nVery deeply.\n\nCHARLIE\nThat'll work fine. [stands]\n\nBARTLET\nNo, it won't.\n\nCharlie sits back down.\n\nBARTLET\nIn my house, anyone who uses one word when they could have used ten just\nisn't trying\nhard.

So,\nof course, you\nhave to be for it on the record, but off the record, it crowds out all the\npork you've\ngot your eye on, like the Senator Enlow Off-Ramp, Rest Stop, Hotel and Casino.\n\nENLOW\nDon't send me notes anymore. [exits]\n\nMILLGATE\nSam, screw the Fruit Loops.\n\nSAM\nSenator!\n\nEnlow was already on the way out of the Communications Office. He stops,\nturns, and goes\nback to SAM'S OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nI apologize. I apologize for my tactics and my behavior.\n\nENLOW\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nOkay. Please don't let that jeopardize, you know... The subcommittee should\nhave hearings\non this. There should be learned testimony.\n\nENLOW\nI'm a Democrat, Sam. How's a 20 billion dollar astronomy lecture gonna help\nthe President\nget elected?\n\nSAM\nIt won't. \"We've discovered a seamless, intellectual framework for the\nuniverse\" isn't\na good 30-second spot.\n\nENLOW\nIf only we could only say what benefit this thing has, but no one's been\nable to do that.\n\nMILLGATE\nThat's because great achievement has no road map. The X-ray's pretty good. So\nis\npenicillin. Neither were discovered with a practical objective in mind. I\nmean, when the\nelectron was discovered in 1897, it was useless. And now, we have an entire\nworld run by\nelectronics. Haydn and Mozart never studied the classics. They couldn't. They\ninvented\nthem.\n\nSAM\nDiscovery.\n\nMILLGATE\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nThat's the thing that you were... Discovery is what. That's what this is\nused for.\nIt's for discovery.\n\nENLOW\nYeah, but you understand that even if this thing passed the Senate, it's\ndead in the\nHouse.\n\nSAM\nJust as long as democracy's not dead in the Senate.\n\nENLOW\nI'll withdraw my anonymous hold.\n\nSAM\n'Cause you're scared of my threat?\n\nENLOW\nYes.\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nENLOW\nYou think I was a hurdle. Good luck with the Appropriations Committee. [turns\nto leave]\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nEnlow raises his hand goodbye on the way out.\n\nMILLGATE\nSee, that wasn't so hard.\n\nSAM\nI've got to get back to the party.\n\nMILLGATE\nI've got to get on a train. [stands]\n\nSAM\nOh, we can get you a room for the night.\n\nMILLGATE\nNo. [puts his coat on]\n\nSAM\nGod, Dalton, isn't there anything? Sloane-Kettering, or...?\n\nMillgate shakes his head.\n\nSAM\nAll right.\n\nMILLGATE\nThanks, Sam.\n\nSAM\nNow you think I'd make a good physicist?\n\nMILLGATE\nNo. But you're not bad for government help. [exits]\n\nCUT TO: INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT\nBack in the party, Big Band music plays. Abbey, C.J. and Amy are standing\nin front of a\ntable watching the band play and the couples dance. C.J., in pain, touches\nher forehead.\nDonna walks up from behind.\n\nDONNA\nMrs. Bartlet?\n\nABBEY\nYes?\n\nDONNA\nExcuse me, but I'm so sorry about the way I spoke before.\n\nABBEY\nOh, don't be. You were good. I've got a surprise for you coming up.\n\nDONNA\nReally?\n\nJosh walks up, passes by Amy, and goes to Donna.\n\nJOSH\nExcuse me.\n\nDONNA\nYes?\n\nJOSH\nDonna... Actually... [turns to Amy] First of all, Amy...\n\nAMY\nYes?\n\nJOSH\n[lowers his voice] I understand, and I forgive you.\n\nAMY\nYou forgive me?\n\nJOSH\nI do.\n\nAMY\nWhat the hell kind of thing is that to...?\n\nABBEY\nHoney.\n\nAMY\nThank you for forgiving me, Josh. I appreciate that.\n\nJOSH\nNo problem.\n\nAMY\n[under her breath] Jackass.\n\nAbbey laughs at the remark. Josh turns back to Donna.\n\nJOSH\nDonna, you're an American again. INS has a grandfather clause. If you pass\na three-part\nliteracy test, an American history exam, and fill out a one-page form,\nyou're back.\n\nDONNA\nMy adopted country.\n\nABBEY\nOh, Josh, I kind of wished you'd mentioned this before.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nDrumroll. Everyone looks at the band as they stand to play the Canadian\nNational Anthem,\n\"O, Canada.\" Two Canadian flags are raised in front of the group, where\nDonna watches\nin amazement.\n\nDONNA\nWow.\n\nABBEY\nYou were very good in there, Donna.\n\nBehind them, Bartlet approaches with Charlie.\n\nBARTLET\n[yells] What the hell is going on?!\n\nABBEY\nShh.\n\nBARTLET\nI was gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.\n\nDONNA\nI know exactly how you feel, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet holds out his hand and takes Abbey aside. The band continues to play.\n\nBARTLET\nI called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are\ndifferent when it\ncomes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand\nthat. I also\nthink partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good\nthing. He's\ngonna consider not recusing himself.\n\nABBEY\nI'm gonna voluntarily forfeit my license for the duration of our stay in\nthe White House.\n\nHer decision comes as a surprise. Bartlet is speechless. The guests start\nto sing.\n\nGUESTS\nO, Canada, our home and native land\nTrue patriot love in all thy sons' command\nWith glowing hearts, we see thee rise...\n\nBartlet finally conjures up a response.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the\nditch story,\nbut I wanted to say that I love you very much.\n\nAbbey is taken aback, fighting back tears.\n\nABBEY\nI love you too, Jethro.\n\nBARTLET\nDon't call me that.\n\nABBEY\nI think I will.\n\nMARBURY\n[walks up] Abigail!\n\nABBEY\nLord John!\n\nMARBURY\nMay I grasp your breasts?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm standing right here!\n\nABBEY\nYou may kiss my cheek.\n\nMARBURY\nExcellent.\n\nHe does. Nearby, Leo walks by and stops.\n\nLEO\nAbbey.\n\nMARBURY\nOh, Gerald.\n\nLEO\nI haven't had a chance to say happy birthday. Happy birthday, Abbey.\n\nLeo kisses her on the cheek. Everyone else greets her.\n\nALL\nHappy birthday, Abbey.\n\nThey all raise up their glasses in honor of the First Lady, as they sing\nthe final line\nof the Canadian National Anthem.\n\nGUESTS\nO, Canada, we stand on guard for thee.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE OUT.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are properties of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television, and NBC.

He sits and watches\nthe\nbroadcaster on television. Camera crews are everywhere. Toby watches nearby.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nGood morning, Mr. President. Good to have you with us.\n\nBARTLET\nGood to be talking to you.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nYou're talking to us from the Map Room this morning?\n\nBARTLET\nThe Mural Room as a matter of fact.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nWell, welcome to Sunrise Cincinnati, sir. And I know you have only a few\nminutes,\nand you want to talk to us about Thursday's prime-time press conference.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's right, and Thursday night we're going to talk about energy dependence\nversus\nindependence and cleaner burning fuels that get up to 80 miles per gallon\nversus\noil-based fuels that pump billions of pounds of pollution into our air and\nperhaps\njust as important our vulnerable to very volatile price spikes. We want to\ntalk about\ncontrolling our destiny through innovation instead of relying so heavily on\nforeign oil.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nOkay, now, you mention foreign oil.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. 65% of the world's oil reserves are in the Mid East. 3% are here at\nhome. I,\nfor one, wouldn't mind sending a little less of my money over there and the\nonly\nalternative is to use less oil.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nLast question Mr. President. Governor Robert Ritchie of Florida the likely\nRepublican\nnominee for the fall campaign, in his new book \"A Promise to Lead,\" he says\nthat we\nshould be exploring the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve for new sources of\nenergy.\nWill this be a hotly-contested campaign topic?\n\nBARTLET\nI hope so, but there'll be plenty of time for campaigning come the\nfall. Thursday night\nis about America's energy future.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nThank you, very much, President Jed Bartlet. It's 12 past the hour. Don't\ngo away.\nWe'll be back with traffic and weather updates.\n\nMAN\nAnd we're out.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nThank you very much sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you, Kim.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nUh... Terry.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm-- Terry, I'm sorry.\n\nTV BRAODCASTER\nThat's all right.\n\nBARTLET\nThat was my ninth interview this morning.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nAre you ready to run against Ritchie?\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I guess we'll be ready to run against whoever we have to run against.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nWhat do you think of him?\n\nBARTLET\nRob Ritchie? I don't know him very well.\n\nTV BROADCASTER\nWell, good luck.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nTOBY\nThey all want to talk about Ritchie's book.\n\nBARTLET\nWe can talk about my book.\n\nTOBY\nTheory and Design of Macro Economics in Developing Nations?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nMAN\nOkay, sir, we have 2 minutes and 20 seconds and it's WKZN Philadelphia.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks.\n\nTOBY\nWhen they say \"exploring\" you got to say \"drilling.\" There's a 12 point kick\nwith\nANWAR between \"exploring\" and drilling.\"\n\nBARTLET\nWhat else?\n\nTOBY\nSaudi Arabia, bad.\n\nBARTLET\nGot it.\n\nC.J.\nHow's it going?\n\nTOBY\nGood.\n\nC.J.\nDo you have a minute?\n\nTOBY\nWell, that's all I've got.\n\nWe follow Toby to C.J.'S OFFICE.\n\nC.J.\nCould you do me a favor? I just got faxed a letter from Tabitha Fortis. She\nsays she's\nnot comfortable going ahead with the dinner next week unless she gets to\nchastise the\nadministration for backing off it's commitment to banning land mines. I'm\nsure its just\na matter of hand-holding. Would you ask Sam to talk to her?\n\nTOBY\nI'll do it.\n\nC.J.\nI thought Sam 'cause he's more familiar with land mines.\n\nTOBY\nI'll talk to her.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nTOBY\n'Cause.\n\nC.J. gets a big grin on her face.\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nC.J.\nIs it possible you've got a little touch of the poet? Or would like a little\ntouch of the poet?\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nOkay, then learn something about land mines, would you? We don't want to\ncancel. About\n300 of the finest minds in the country are coming, plus some Congressmen.\n\nTOBY\nIt'll be fine.\n\nC.J.\nKnock 'em dead, de Bergerac.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Thanks for having me.\n\nTV REPORTER\nAnd you're here to talk about Thursday's prime-time press conference.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd to shill for my new energy plan, which is about raising fuel economy\nstandards, working\nwith Detroit to develop hybrid cars, and using tax incentives to promote\nalternative energy.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWhy is alternative energy important?\n\nBARTLET\nAfter a decade of wars with Iraq and a spread of religious extremism in\nSaudi Arabia, we\nstill rely on this very dangerous, very uncertain region for a quarter of\nour oil reserves.\nAnd I, for one, wouldn't mind not sending quite so much of my money there.\n\nTV REPORTER\nNow, wouldn't that suggest that Florida Governor Robert Ritchie was correct\nin his book\n\"A Promise to Lead\" when he says we should be opening up the Arctic for\nexploration?\n\nBARTLET\nExploring is what Magellan did and Balboa and Jacques Cousteau. What we're\ntalking about\nis drilling which is the only way you know if there's oil there and which\nwill forever\ndamage national treasures like ANWAR.\n\nTV REPORTER\nWhat about Clean Coal?\n\nBARTLET\nClean Coal is a term that pollsters came up with 'cause it polls higher then\nregular coal.\nWhat we want are real cleaner burning fuels. We want to control our destiny\nthrough\ninnovation and that's what we're going to be talking about Thursday night.\n\nTV REPORTER\nMr. President, thank you very much for being with us today.\n\nBARTLET\nMy pleasure.\n\nTV REPORTER\nIt's 16 past the hour.

I think we might be talking about a .22 caliber mind\nin a .357 magnum world.\n\nTV REPORTER\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, thanks again. [to Toby] Who's next?\n\nTOBY\nYou were hot.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nWhen you said that just now. You were hot.

C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\nC.J., Josh and Sam are inside.\n\nJOSH\nHow'd the tape get out already?\n\nSAM\nWe were just talking about that.\n\nC.J.\nThere was a local AP reporter at the station in Philly.\n\nJOSH\nThey didn't want to keep it for an exclusive?\n\nC.J.\nIt's better for them to have their call letters splashed on every... and\nthe networks\nwill carry it tonight.\n\nJOSH\nThis is amateur crap, Sam. How'd it happen?\n\nSAM\nWell, first of all, I wasn't there.\n\nJOSH\nWho was there?\n\nSAM\nMy boss. The White House Director of Communications. It wasn't his fault,\neither. It was\neight seconds. It was his tenth interview. He didn't see that the green\nlight was...\n\nJOSH\nAll right, you're right. What's first?\n\nC.J.\nI have the briefing room in 20 minutes.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do you think you're going to get?\n\nC.J.\nIs the President saying Governor Ritchie's stupid?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nNo.\n\nSAM\nYes, is the only answer to that question.\n\nJOSH\nWhy not, the President has the highest regard for Governor Ritchie. Believes\nhe's a broad\nthinker and a dedicated public servant?\n\nSAM\nBecause it's the Press Briefing Room, not the Improv. There's no way for\nher to walk this\nback. She'll sound disingenuous at best. Naive at worst.\n\nJOSH\nI'm more concerned with how the President sounds.\n\nC.J.\nI've got 80 boys and girls in there who don't make the distinction. And if\nI pretend Bobby\nRitchie's a nuclear physicist...\n\nSAM\nThen don't answer it. We're focusing on energy and dependence this week.\n\nC.J.\nNo, we're focusing on this this week. I can try a non-apology apology.\n\nJOSH\nTry it.\n\nC.J.\n\"The President didn't realize that the camera was hot and he said something\nhe shouldn't\nhave, as we all do from time to time.\"\n\nJOSH\nNice.\n\nSAM\nYeah.

(exits)\n\nJOSH\nWhy do you suppose this one's so hard to spin?\n\nC.J.\n'Cause it's the classic Washington scandal. We screwed up by telling the\ntruth.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. Lets try not to do that that much.\n\nWe follow Josh into his BULLPEN AREA where we see Donna, Bonnie, Ginger,\nand Margaret\ngathered around Donna's computer laughing and whispering.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's going on?\n\nGINGER\nHi, sugar lips.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry?\n\nMARGARET\nDonna struck gold.\n\nJOSH\nWhat is it?\n\nBONNIE\nLemonLyman.com.\n\nJOSH\nWhat is it?\n\nDONNA\nIt's your fan site.\n\nJOSH\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nDONNA\nThere's a website devoted to all things \"Josh.\"\n\nJOSH\nYou're kidding me.\n\nDONNA\nNo.\n\nJOSH\nLemonLyman.com?\n\nDONNA\nYou have fans, Josh.

You on \"Capitol Beat.\" You on \"Meet the Press.\" You in \"US News\" and\n\"World Report.\"\n\nBONNIE\nWell, there's also the section called \"Sightings about Town.\"\n\nDONNA\nThis is reserved for actual Josh encounters of the third kind.

This,\nit should\npainfully self-explanatory, is where the women, and more then a few men I\ngotta say,\ndiscuss what they would do with you if...\n\nJOSH\nAll right, can everybody who doesn't work here, please go work where they\nwork.\n\nMARGARET\nI want to work here now.\n\nJOSH\nYou can get this at your own desk.\n\nMARGARET\nYou better believe it.\n\nDONNA\nSee you at lunch.\n\nMargaret, Ginger and Bonnie leave.\n\nDONNA\nAll right, you've got Senior Senior Staff at C.O.S., then Senior staff in\nthe Roosevelt Room.\nThere's a meeting with the economic team to pre-brief for Fed Chair, and\nthat's followed\nimmediately by Advance, State, and NSC to go over the next six months of\nforeign travel.\n\nJOSH\nLet me look at this thing.\n\nHe leans over Donna and tries to look at the web site on her computer.\n\nDONNA\nJosh...?\n\nJOSH\nRight.

They'll want assurances no mandates, no timetable, make the whole\nthing voluntary\nand industry-led.\n\nBARTLET\nPolluters aren't going to write the environmental laws. What about the\nEnergy's Workers Union?\n\nLEO\nThey just want to know it's Saudi jobs we're after.\n\nBARTLET\nIt is.\n\nLEO\nLook, the money's in raising the CAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon. That's\nthe meeting\nthat's coming to my door.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat else?\n\nLEO\nYou're going to be reprimanded tomorrow night on the house floor.\n\nBARTLET\nFor what?\n\nLEO\nIt's not nice to call people dumb.\n\nBARTLET\nLet me ask you something. You're pretty dumb, did you take offense? Look at\nthat. I did it again.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah?\n\nCHARLIE\nShe's ready to start.\n\nLeo and Bartlet begin to walk into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.\n\nLEO\nSeriously, the GOP's lining up a bunch of people for order speeches.\n\nBARTLET\nCalling me impolite?\n\nLEO\nI guess.\n\nNANCY\nHe's here. You can send her in.\n\nLEO\nAnyway, the Whip's got about a 150 Democrats ready to rebut. You have any\nspecial preferences?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't know. I guess the biggest names.\n\nLEO\nKnow what we'd do if we were smart? We wouldn't send anybody. We'd look so\ngood by not\nshowing up. Let them whine by themselves.\n\nWe pan from Leo and Bartlet to a TV set in the outer office where we see\nthe press\nbriefing has begun.\n\nREPORTERS (on T.V.)\nGood morning, C.J..\n\nC.J.\nGood morning.\n\nREPORTER 1 (on T.V.)\nC.J., was the President saying that Governor Ritchie isn't up to the job of\nbeing President?\n\nC.J.\nThe President didn't realize the camera was hot, and he said something he\nshouldn't have.\nSomething we all do from time to time.\n\nLEO\nNice.\n\nREPORTER 2 (on T.V.)\nIsn't it a bit early in the season to be going negative?\n\nC.J.\nYeah, again, he said something he shouldn't have and he wouldn't have if he\nknew it was\ngoing to be for public consumption.\n\nSTUART (on T.V.)\nC.J., has he made the same kind of remarks in private?\n\nC.J.\nThere's a reason they call it private, Stuart.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, I'm going back to work.\n\nLEO\nAll right.\n\nBartlet and Leo walk out of the room while the camera stays on the TV.\n\nREPORTER (on T.V.)\nC.J., is the President saying that he's smarter than Governor Ritchie?\n\nC.J.\nThe voters get to make those kinds of judgments.\n\nREPORTERS (on T.V.)\nC.J.! C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nYes?\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE PRESS ROOM - DAY\n\n\tTUESDAY\n\nMARK\nGovernor Ritchie is calling on the President to apologize?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nMARK\nWill he?\n\nC.J.\nAs I said yesterday, the President didn't realize the camera was hot and he\nsaid\nsomething he shouldn't have. Katie?\n\nKATIE\nThe Ritchie camp is also challenging the President to sign a pledge basically\na promise\nto run a positive, issue-oriented campaign.\n\nC.J.\nWell, for one thing, while the Governor is the presumptive Republican nominee,\nit's\npresumptive. For that matter, so is the President's renomination. But more\nimportant\nthan that, the President has been a candidate in seven statewide and national\nelections\nand every one of them has been a substantive, issued-based campaign, which\nis one of\nseveral reasons why the voters have elected him each and every time his name\nhas\nappeared on a ballot. Phil?\n\nPHIL\nWere you aware that several news organizations have been trying to obtain\nGovernor\nRitchie's transcripts from the University of Florida?\n\nC.J.\nYou mean since yesterday?\n\nPHIL\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nNo I wasn't.\n\nPHIL\nI guess my question is does the President feel college transcripts are an\naccurate\nbarometer of a person's fitness to hold a high public office?\n\nC.J.\nI've never asked him, but my guess is the President feels that a person's\ncollege\ntranscripts is a reasonable barometer of how a person did in\ncollege. [laughter]\nFor the record, the President graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University\nof\nNotre Dame with a major in American Studies and a minor in theology. He\nreceived a\nMasters and a Doctorate at the London School of Economics and an honorary\nDoctorate\nin Humane Letters from Dartmouth University where he was a tenured professor.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Don't give him what he wants.\n\nSAM\nI'm told I seldom give anybody what they want.\n\nC.J.\nWe cant hold a bipartisan summit on bipartisanism, we'll look ridiculous.\n\nSAM\nWe're used to that, aren't we?\n\nC.J.\nSam...\n\nSAM\nI'm not giving him what he wants.\n\nC.J.\nIs it me, or is Ritchie's people handling this wrong?\n\nSAM\nIt's not you.\n\nC.J.\nWhy keep it alive?

And it happened\nquickly and\nwe regret it.\n\nWACHTELL\nHow's reaction been so far?\n\nSAM\nOur base is very happy, but when our base is happy, there's usually trouble\nsomeplace else.\n\nWACHTELL\nThe moderates are talking about bolting the party.\n\nSAM\nNobody's bolting the party, it was an honest mistake. And, by the way,\nhad nothing to do\nwith partisanism.\n\nWACHTELL\nWell, something has to be done.\n\nSAM\nThere's very little that can be done from the Communications Office.\n\nWACHTELL\nA summit...\n\nSAM\nCongressman...\n\nWACHTELL\nA summit on bipartisan cooperation.\n\nSAM\nI can bring it up but it'll get laughed out of the room.\n\nWACHTELL\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nIt's an election year. We want to be partisan. We're trying to beat them.\n\nWACHTELL\nWell, I've got to be able to go back and tell my moderate friends\nsomething. What about\na Republican appointment, or promotion?\n\nSAM\nWe've got Ainsley Hayes.\n\nWACHTELL\nThat name sounds familiar.\n\nSAM\nShe was Associate White House Counsel, got promoted to Deputy Counsel,\nand she's just\nslightly to the right of the Kaiser.\n\nWACHTELL\nI'd make her visible right now.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir, that's a good idea.\n\nWACHTELL\nAnd learn to tell the difference between red and green.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nWACHTELL\nOkay then.\n\nAs the congressman exits, Sam gets up from desk and walks back out to the\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nOFFICE.\n\nSAM\nGinger...

We've invited 300 important people,\nwe've invited\nthe press, we've shined our shoes...\n\nTABITHA\nYou've got to sign the land mine treaty, Toby.\n\nTOBY\nWhoa... What happened to the nuance of diplomacy?\n\nTABITHA\nOh, sorry, the shoes are shined.\n\nTOBY\nNo we-we're there now, you-you can't go back.\n\nTABITHA\nSorry.\n\nTOBY\nRight.\n\nTABITHA\n142 countries have signed it, 84 have ratified, 12 destroyed there entire\nstock.\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nTABITHA\nYou know who hasn't signed it? Us and Cuba.\n\nTOBY\nYou know who initiated it? Us. And the nations of the world rallied around\nit in yet\nanother impressive display of American leadership.\n\nTABITHA\nAnd then?\n\nTOBY\nWe bolted.\n\nTABITHA\nRight.\n\nTOBY\nAnd the reason we did is because we love anti-personnel land mines. We love\n'em. And we\nthink the government should be in the business of selling them, like the\nPost Office.\nIn fact, the Post Office is the sales venue we've been considering.\n\nTABITHA\nToby. I-I got a...\n\nTOBY\nIt's Korea. Tabitha. There are 900,000 North Korean soldiers in the DMZ,\nand the only\nthing stopping them from walking into South Korea are 37,000 US troops,\nand about a\nmillion land mines along the border. We have said over and over that we\nwould be thrilled\nto sign this treaty if we could have an exemption for South Korea and we\nhave been rebuffed.\nRebuffed... I say.\n\nTABITHA\nLook, so we disagree on this... clearly, what's the big deal?\n\nTOBY\nNot a big deal at all.\n\nTABITHA\nExcept?\n\nTOBY\nIf you voice your disagreement at a party in your honor hosted by the\nPresident with the\npress in attendance then it's a gigantic deal which travels the 63 feet\nright to this office.\n\nTABITHA\nAll right then.

They play\nfootball as an independent. They play basketball in the Big East. Second,\nwe're very\ninterested in education in this White House, so can you tell me what's wrong\nwith the\nIvy League?

That's treasonous.\n\nTOBY\nCan we stop with the drama?\n\nTABITHA\nToby?\n\nTOBY\nTabitha, you don't know what you're doing. This isn't kid's stuff. If you\nstand up in the\nPresident's face, that's going to be the story, and nobody's going to care\nabout what you\ncare about. Nobody is going to care about what you care about. And...

Nobody's\nsaying the President\nneeds to have a tenured chair in semiotics, but you have to have...\n\nAINSLEY\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nGravitas.\n\nAINSLEY\n[leaning forward] And how do you measure that?\n\nSAM\nYou don't, but we know it when we see it, and Republicans tend to mock it\nwhen they do.\nYou think I'm wrong?\n\nAINSLEY\nI do not.\n\nSAM\nNo you don't, and the way I know you don't is I saw you say so on television.\n\nToby appears in the doorway, still in his coat.\n\nSAM\nHey, Toby.\n\nAinsley stands up.\n\nTOBY\nWhy are you here?\n\nSAM\nThe TV isn't working in my office.\n\nTOBY\n[to Ainsley] You did good on TV.\n\nAINSLEY\nThanks. I'll be in my office.\n\nToby stands aside to let her through the door as she leaves, the sound of\nher holiday\nflip-flops clearly audible. Toby heads past Sam, who is now sitting up,\nto his desk.\n\nSAM\nHow's it going with the poet?\n\nTOBY\nI'm not sure.\n\nSAM\nDoes she have a strong history of activism?\n\nTOBY\nShe has no history of activism. She said something yesterday, when I was\nwith her, she said-\nshe was talking about land mines - she said, \"From everything I've seen and\neverything I've\nbeen told...\"\n\nSAM\nYou think she's getting some pressure?\n\nTOBY\n[shrugging] I don't-\n\nGinger knocks on door.\n\nGINGER [OS]\nToby?\n\nTOBY\n[turns to her] Yeah.\n\nGINGER\nIt's someone from Georgetown University. I think there's a problem.\n\nToby takes this in.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\nJosh walks past Donna then notices her and comes back.\n\nJOSH\nThe Internet people have gone crazy.\n\nDONNA\n[sarcastically] You're kidding.\n\nThe two of them start to walk together.\n\nJOSH\nThey're calling the GAO \"General Josh's Standing Army\", and saying I don't\nunderstand\nit's mandate and purpose. They're saying if I could get a review of anything\nI want,\nthat I should start by reviewing the job of Deputy C.O.S. Then one guy\ncompares me to\na poor man's Clark Clifford, and a page and a half of posts, debating whether\nor not\nI was mocking Egyptians with the Sanskrit reference.\n\nThey come to a halt.\n\nDONNA\n[snappishly] I told you they were hysterical.\n\nJOSH\nI thought you meant they were funny.\n\nDONNA\nThey're not.\n\nThey start walking again, voices rising.\n\nJOSH\nI know they're not! It's \"Lord of the Flies\" in there.\n\nDONNA\nWell, who invited you in the first place?\n\nJOSH\nIt's got my name on it. Look, I don't want to hear about it anymore. [glances\nat his watch]\nWe got an energy plan in ten minutes. I'm gonna...\n\nHe starts to walk away, and C.J. comes up the HALLWAY behind him.\n\nC.J.\nOh Josh!\n\nJOSH\nYeah?\n\nHe turns and waits as she walks towards him.\n\nC.J.\nThe Federal Page of the Washington Post just called Carol to confirm that\nyou're the\nJosh Lyman who stated on an Internet website that the White House could\norder a GAO\nreview on anything it wants.\n\nJOSH\nWithout threatening the separation of powers is what I was saying.\n\nC.J.\nYou posted on a web site?\n\nDonna emerges from a door behind C.J., and they exchange a look.\n\nJOSH\nI was communicating with the people.\n\nC.J.\nReally?\n\nJosh is momentarily distracted watching Donna walk past him into his\noffice. Then he\nsteps closer to C.J. and speaks in a hushed voice.\n\nJOSH\nC.J., it's a... crazy place. It's got this dictatorial leader, who I'm sure\nwears a muumuu\nand chain smokes Parliaments. [makes a smoking gesture with his fingers]\n\nC.J.\nWhat did you go there for in the first place?\n\nJOSH\nIt's called LemonLyman.com.\n\nC.J. gives him a pointed shove in the direction of his office. They walk a\nfew paces and\nstop outside the doorway.\n\nC.J.\nLet me explain something to you, this is sort of my field. The people on\nthese sites?\nThey're the cast of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\"\n\nDonna picks up her jacket inside the office and walks out between the two\nof them.\n\nC.J. [cont]\nThe muumuu wearing Parliament smoker? That's Nurse Ratched. When Nurse\nRatched is unhappy,\nthe patients are unhappy. You? You're McMurphy. You swoop in there with your\ncard games\nand your fishing trips...\n\nJOSH\n[shrugging defensively] I didn't swoop in, I came in exactly the same way\neverybody else did.\n\nC.J.\nWell, now I'm telling you to open the ward room window and climb on out\nbefore they give you\na pre-frontal lobotomy, and I have to smother you with a pillow.\n\nJosh regards her in silence for a moment.\n\nJOSH\nYou're Chief Brom-\n\nC.J.\nI'm Chief Bromden, yes, at this particular moment. I'm assigning an intern\nfrom the press\noffice to that web site. They're going to check it every night before they\ngo home. If they\ndiscover you've been there, I'm going to shove a motherboard so far up your\nass...\n\nJosh looks down at the floor.\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\n[with a slight shrug] Well... technically, I outrank you.\n\nC.J.\n[shouting] So far up your ass!\n\nJOSH\n[quickly] Okay.\n\nC.J.\nOkay?\n\nJOSH\nHow you doing?\n\nC.J.\nAre we ready?\n\nJOSH\n[nods] We are.\n\nC.J.\nI believe we are. You want to walk over?\n\nHe hesitates, then turns to walk with her.\n\nJOSH\n[calling out] Donna, let's go, it's time.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE A LECTURE HALL - NIGHT\nThe camera pans past a large signboard which says \"Tabitha Fortis Poet\nLaureate Lectures\nTonight at 9:00 P.M.\" to Toby as he approaches. He spots two people.\n\nTOBY\nExcuse me?\n\nMAN\nAre you Mr. Ziegler?\n\nTOBY\nWhat happened?\n\nMAN\nWell, she was giving her lecture, and then towards the end something... I\ndon't know.\nI think she's okay, but I asked her if there was anyone I could call.\n\nTOBY\nWhere is she?\n\nWOMAN\n[gesturing over her shoulder] She's sitting out on the steps.\n\nTOBY\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nMAN\nMm-hmm.\n\nToby walks past and then pauses and turns back.\n\nTOBY\nWas there any press there tonight?\n\nMAN\nFor a poetry lecture?\n\nTOBY\nRight.\n\nToby walks off.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. SQUARE OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS\nToby walks past a large fountain toward where Tabitha sits facing away from\nhim at the\ntop of the steps. She doesn't look up until he's right beside her. They\nexchange a look,\nand then he sits down next to her. The sound of the fountain is loud in the\nbackground.\n\nTABITHA\n[after a moment] There was a man in Banja Luka that I met. He took his son\nand I...\nto go fishing in the Sava River. And the little boy, uh... hooked a piece\nof garbage...\nand when he tried to take it off the line, it blew him up. Right in front\nof his father,\nand, uh... right in front of me.\n\nTOBY\nWhat happened tonight?\n\nTabitha sighs heavily.\n\nTABITHA\nUm... I decided to highlight poets who were never chosen Poet Laureate\n'cause they were\ntoo rebellious. Adrienne Rich, Anne Sexton, Allen Ginsberg and I went into\n\"Howl.\" I know\n\"Howl\" like you know voting districts. \"I saw the best minds of my generation\ndestroyed\nby madness, starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves through...\" and\nthen, uh...\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nTABITHA\nI couldn't remember any more. I couldn't, uh... You know, I-I couldn't\nremember any more.\n[beat] You think I think that an artist's job is to speak the truth. An\nartist's job...\nis to captivate you for however long we've asked for your attention. If we\nstumble into\ntruth, we got lucky, and I don't get to decide what truth is. What you said\nabout South\nKorea makes sense, you know, uh, people know more then I do. I... I shouldn't\nbe uh...\nyou know... I write poetry, Toby, that's how I enter the world. [beat]\nI was thinking\nmaybe, you know... I-I don't if you could do this, but... I was thinking if\nI could get\na few minutes alone with the President, so that could tell him what I saw\nin Banja Luka?\n[beat] Then it wouldn't have to be a thing, you know, at the dinner... in\nthere I could,\nuh... I have 64 couplets on the American experience that I think might be\nappropriate.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, we can do that.\n\nToby reaches for a pocket inside of his coat and pulls out a small notepad. He\nflips\nthrough the pages and shows it to Tabitha.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's that say?\n\nTABITHA\n[reading] \"Meet Tabitha Fortis\".\n\nToby produces a pen and crosses her name off of the list. Tabitha chuckles.\n\nTOBY\nI have to be at a press conference.\n\nTABITHA\nRight.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDORS - NIGHT\nPeople bustle about, looking busy. C.J. and Charlie pass by, Charlie reading\na document\nas he walks.\n\nC.J.\nSo as a matter of cold fact, Chipper, you'll see that it's the Porcupine\nCaribou, and\nANWARS's their calving ground, and you can't put a price tag on that, but\nthat's hardly\nthe point.\n\nCharlie turns back the top page to read.\n\nCHARLIE\n36 species of fish, 36 land mammals, 160 different bird species. [closes\nthe document]\nI admit, this is a lot of wildlife.\n\nThey come to a halt.\n\nC.J.\nWell, forget the wildlife, it hurts flesh and blood subsistence hunters in\nthe area,\nchanges migratory patterns in ways we don't even understand, increases\nfreezing depths\nof rivers and lakes...\n\nCHARLIE\nAnd the emissions from drilling.\n\nC.J.\nWelcome home, it'll cause pollutant haze and acid rain, and all this in\nexchange for?\n\nCHARLIE\nNot a lot of oil to begin with.\n\nBartlet and Leo approach together.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, here we go. What time is it?\n\nCHARLIE\nNine o'clock, sir.\n\nLEO\n[to Bartlet] We'll see you inside.\n\nBARTLET\n[to the room] Thank you, everyone.\n\nEverybody heads off in different directions, and Bartlet looks back as\nC.J. walks past.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J.?\n\nShe heads back towards him.\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI've been meaning to tell you, you've done really well this week with the\nopen-mike thing.\n\nC.J.\nThank you.\n\nHe slips on his glasses and looks up at her.\n\nBARTLET\nDidn't turn out too bad.\n\nC.J.\nNo sir, it didn't turn out too bad at all. In fact, the whole country's\ntalking about\nwhether Ritchie's smart enough to be President. And you didn't take hit,\n'cause it was an\naccident. You know, it occurs to me that even your choice of language was\ninteresting.\n\"A .22 caliber mind, in a .357 magnum world.\" That's unusual for you, a gun\nmetaphor.\n\nBartlet doesn't look up, seeming to be engrossed in whatever he's reading.\n\nC.J. [cont]\nToby mentioned to me that when each interview was over, all the interviewers\nwanted to\ntalk to you about was Ritchie, and you took a pass each time. Until\nPhiladelphia.\n\nNow Bartlet slowly looks up at her.\n\nC.J. [cont]\nMr. President, is it possible you saw that the green light was on?\n\nHe slips the glasses off and gives her an unreadable look.\n\nANNOUNCER [VO]\nLadies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.\n\nC.J. smiles.\n\nC.J.\nThat was Old School.\n\nHe turns back to look at her.\n\nC.J.\nGo knock 'em dead.\n\nBartlet walks away from her towards the microphones as cameras flash.

You know what I'd do if I owned\na hockey\nteam? I'd hire a sumo wrestler. I'd give him a uniform, transportation,\n500 bucks a week\nto sit in the goal, eat a ham sandwich, and enjoy the game. My team would\nnever get\nscored on.\n\nJOSH\nYour team would get scored on constantly.\n\nSAM\nMaybe, but we'd sell a few tickets.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, 'cause sumo wrestling sells out all the time in big hockey towns.\n\nSAM\nMy idea's totally inviable?\n\nJOSH\nWell, you're a Democrat.

[calls] Milo, Coop, would you help Mr. Young find his pockets,\nplease?\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm fine. There's been a mistake.\n\nMilo and Coop, two Secret Service agents on duty, loom over Charlie as he\nworks on his\ntax returns. Bartlet and C.J. enter THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry to come straight to you, but Leo's unavailable right now. You\nshould be getting\na call from the Energy Secretary any minute.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat happened?\n\nC.J.\nThe wire service is reporting that a heavy-haul vehicle carrying depleted\nuranium fuel\nrods crashed in the Seven Devil Mountains in Idaho.\n\nBARTLET\nIt crashed?\n\nC.J.\nIt was hit head-on by another truck, in the Goldfield Tunnel on Route 234.\n\nBARTLET\nAre there populated areas nearby?\n\nC.J.\nElk Horn's about 20 miles away with a population of 20,000.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie?\n\nCHARLIE\n[walking in] The Energy Secretary's on the phone.\n\nBARTLET\nConference in the Chief with the Radiological Assistance Team.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie, get me Fitzwallace, Nancy McNally, and let the senior members of\nthe NSC know\nI might need them tonight.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.

Several staffers,\nincluding Josh,\nToby and Ed, are inside for the meeting.\n\nC.J.\nA truck carrying depleted uranium fuel rods just crashed in Idaho 20 miles\nfrom a\npopulated town.\n\nJOSH\nWell, what's happening right now?\n\nC.J.\nThe President's talking to Tommy about the radiation threat, and he's talking\nto some\nNational Security people.\n\nLARRY\n[walking in] There's a problem.\n\nC.J.\nI'm just telling them.\n\nLARRY\nIt was a 24-ton Type B light cask holding spent fuel rods from the nuclear\ncarrier Truman.\n\nED\nDoes 24-ton Type B mean anything to anybody?\n\nLARRY\nIt's a heavy truck. You got to hit it with another heavy truck.\n\nTOBY\nWhy National Security?\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nYou said he was also talking to National Security People.\n\nC.J.\nTwo trucks in a completely deserted area, and they just happen to crash into\neach other?\nI'd want to talk to somebody at least.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. Listen, postpone the meeting. [stands]\n\nTOBY\nNo, let's do it.\n\nJOSH\nIt's gonna be all night.\n\nTOBY\nWhen we get pulled out, we get pulled out.\n\nJOSH\nIt doesn't really seem appropriate right now.\n\nTOBY\nYou spent a long night with Bruno last night.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, and Bruno spent a long night with Doug the night before.\n\nC.J.\nAnd?\n\nJOSH\nThere's no electoral math they can come up with. None. That says it's not\nworth exploring\nreplacing the Vice President on the ticket.\n\nThe room falls silent. C.J. sits slowly.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT\nThe meeting continues.\n\nTOBY\nNot five months ago, in this room I'd said-I joked--that if we win re-election\nit was\ngoing to be on the Vice-President's coattails. The way I'm sure I said it\nis that it was\nleaked. How has the electoral math changed since then?\n\nJOSH\nBy the way... the group of people were chosen because they're the people\nLeo wanted to\nhear from tonight but also, because he was confident their wouldn't be a\nleak and I hope\nwe live up to that.\n\nTOBY\nHow has the math changed?\n\nJOSH\nBruno doesn't think that Hoynes buys us Texas with Ritchie in the race. If\nwe loose Texas\nthis time, we loose Florida this time, that's a third of the electoral votes\nwe need to\nwin. There's a reason the Republicans are nominating this man.\n\nC.J.\nWho does?\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nC.J.\nWho does win Texas for us?\n\nJOSH\nNobody, we're loosing Texas.\n\nTOBY\nWait a second, before we go on to who does win Texas.\n\nC.J.\nI was just saying...\n\nTOBY\nWe've been talking about this for a minute and 17 sec and we're already\ndiscussing new\ncandidates?\n\nC.J.\nI was saying that if no ones going to win us Texas then why change it all?\n\nJOSH\nCan I make it clear that nobody's advocating anything?\n\nTOBY\nBruno and Doug are.\n\nJOSH\nBruno asked for a discussion.\n\nLARRY\nWhat was the answer to C.J.'s question?\n\nTOBY\nThe Northeast, the Pacific coast and the industrial Northwest.\n\nJOSH\nYeah. If we don't have Florida and Texas it'd mean we'd have to sweep those\nthree.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nED\nAnd he thinks Hoynes hurts us there?\n\nJOSH\nHe thinks someone else could help us more.\n\nC.J.\nDid he say who?\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nWho?\n\nJOSH\nFitzwallace. He said Fitzwallace, Toby. And when you think about it...\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nLEO\n[enters] Josh.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nJosh leaves the room with Leo into the HALLWAY, then into LEO'S OFFICE.\n\nLEO\nHow's it going in there?\n\nJOSH\nAh... you know... we're just starting.\n\nLEO\nWell make sure you get creative. Get people thinking even though you know\nit's...\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nI'm going to go in there alone for a minute.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nKnocking on the door and Leo enters.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nLEO\nI was just briefed. They're setting up a joint operations command in Elks\nHorn. I wish\nI'd been here a half hour ago.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat would you have done a half hour ago that hasn't already been done?\n\nLEO\nI'd have known a half hour ago what I know now. This is exactly why I'm not\ngoing to my\nmeeting anymore--it's a luxury.\n\nBARTLET\nI know. If only technology could invent some way to get in touch with you\nin an\nemergency. Some sort of telephonic device with a personalized number we\ncould call to let\nyou know that we needed you. Perhaps it would look something like this,\nMr. Moto!\n[reaches into Leo's back pocket and pulls out a pager]\n\nLEO\nYou should've called me.\n\nBARTLET\nWould you stop?\n\nLEO\nAll right. Obviously we're coordinating with the governor's office and state\nFEMA in\nBoise.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know I've noticed that other people keep a set of comfortable clothes\nin their office\nfor when they have to work late. I like that -- you should do that too.\n\nLEO\nI do do that.\n\nBARTLET\nOh. You should change.\n\nLEO\nYou see me wearing a necktie?\n\nBARTLET\nNever mind.\n\nLEO\nCan I have my pager back?\n\nBartlet tosses it to him over his back\n\nLEO\nThe hazard assessment by the RAD team is good. No airborne release of cesium\nisotopes.\nNo gamma or neutron radiation readings.\n\nBARTLET\nBut?\n\nLEO\nBoth trucks are still burning. The fire commander's pulling out his men and\nequipment\nas soon as possible.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm pretty sure he's right.\n\nLEO\nYeah these things haven't tested for tunnel fires. They're built to withstand\n1,475\nFahrenheit for 30 minutes but apparently a train tunnel in Baltimore burned\nat 1,500.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, Leo?\n\nLEO\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI knew this a half hour ago.\n\nLEO\nRight.\n\nBARTLET\nThis whole night I'm going to be a half hour smarter than you.\n\nLEO\nOk. So you know about the other truck.\n\nBARTLET\n[surprised] No.\n\nLEO\nIt was stolen from a rest stop outside of Glen's Ferry two weeks ago.\n\nBARTLET\nThe driver's dead?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nArab?\n\nLEO\nNo. He's Garry Vernon Clarke.\n\nBARTLET\nIs that his name or is that what we think it is right now?\n\nLEO\n[nods] Looks like it was an accident.\n\nBARTLET\nIn what happens to be the most dangerous and unanticipated situation for the\ntransportation of nuclear waste.\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\n[sighs] What's that meeting next door?\n\nLEO\nDon't worry about it.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nJOSH\nDid I leave a folder called \"Southeast Targets and...\"\n\nDonna comes up from behind and hands him the folder.\n\nJOSH\nThank you.\n\nThey begin to walk.\n\nDONNA\nI've been putting together a folder of my own. All the things that need to\nbe done in\norder for the President to issue a proclamation.\n\nJOSH\nWhat has to be done?\n\nDONNA\nLet me check... Nothing.\n\nJOSH\nDonna.\n\nDONNA\nNothing has to be done.\n\nJOSH\nHe can't just issue a proclamation.\n\nDONNA\nHe can.\n\nJOSH\nNo I'm saying he can't just because you want him to. What's next, executive\nclemency if\nyou're having a bad hair day?\n\nDONNA\nI never have a bad hair day and Molly Morello was a public school teacher\nfor 41 years.\n\nJOSH\nWhich is nice but these things are for important causes, not individual\nperks for\nstaffers.\n\nDONNA\nNational Digestive Diseases Awareness Week.\n\nJOSH\nWhen was that?\n\nDONNA\nRight now. It began after General Pulaski Memorial Day.\n\nJOSH\nLook, if you're going to mock the dead...\n\nDONNA\nFebruary was National Sewing Month, by the way.\n\nJOSH\nIt's still the President's name and reputation. We haven't vetted this woman.\n\nDONNA\nYou're saying that if she's a lesbian...\n\nJOSH\nIf she were a lesbian we could talk. I'm saying what if she's a bicycle thief?\n\nDONNA\nI doubt that she's...\n\nJOSH\nDon't doubt it. Know it. Do a Google search, then talk to me.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

No, that's fine.\n\nHOYNES\nI got held up at a poker game.\n\nSAM\nI love poker.\n\nHOYNES\nI heard you had Caps tickets.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nHOYNES\nHow was the game?\n\nSAM\nNot very good.\n\nHOYNES\nHave you ever seen a good hockey game?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nHOYNES\nMe neither. I love sports, I just can't get next to hockey. See, I think\nAmericans like\nto savour situations. One down, bottom of the ninth, one run game, first\nand third, left\nhanded batter, right hand reliever, infield at double play depth, here's\nthe pitch. But\nscoring in hockey seems to come out of nowhere. The play-by-play guy is\nalways shocked.\nLePeiter passes to Huckenchuck who skates past the blue line. Huckenchuck,\nof course,\nwas traded from Winnipeg for a case of Labatts after sitting out last season\nwith...\n\"Oh my God, he scores!\" So, what's going on?\n\nSAM\n[sighs] They're marking up the Internet Education Act tomorrow.\n\nHOYNES\nTomorrow?\n\nSAM\nYes sir, and they're zeroing out the Technology Challenge Fund.\n\nHOYNES\nTomorrow?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir. We only heard about it tonight.\n\nHOYNES\nWe're going to save this thing.\n\nSAM\nThat's what I'm here for.\n\nHOYNES\nIt's only $52 million.\n\nSAM\nIt's going to be embarrassing.\n\nHOYNES\n75% of the poorest Americans don't have Internet access. 60% of Blacks and\nHispanics\ndon't have Internet access. I have to make some calls.\n\nSAM\nYeah, the problem is...\n\nHOYNES\nWhat?\n\nSAM\nThe Chairman. You attacked him at the DNC Spring...\n\nHOYNES\nYou sent me to attack him.\n\nSAM\nI understand.\n\nHOYNES\nThey're marking it up tomorrow?\n\nSAM\nYes sir.\n\nHOYNES\nYou're going to do this for me.

Black turn out would explode, we'd realign the country.\n\nC.J.\nThat's assuming it stays a two-man race.\n\nJOSH\nWho's going to get into it this late?\n\nC.J. gives him a look and turns to Toby.\n\nTOBY\nJohn Hoynes.\n\nJOSH\nHoynes, as... an Independent?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nThe guy practically has corporate sponsorship. The Tostitos Vice President\nis going to\nlead an independent movement?\n\nLARRY\nIt's not that ridiculous.\n\nJOSH\nIt is that ridiculous! He'd be finished in politics.\n\nTOBY\nSome future he'll have after we publicly humiliate him by kicking him off\nthe ticket.\n\nJOSH\nSo, bring it on. What are we afraid of?\n\nC.J.\nHow about a household name with his own base of conservative Democrats and\npopulist\nIndependents.\n\nTOBY\nStarts at 15, maybe 20%. Now, every state's up for grabs 'cause it's a three\nway.\n\nJOSH\nBut he'll loose.\n\nC.J.\nWhich is gratifying, of course but not much of a consolation since we'll\nloose too.\n\nJOSH\nYou say what you want, Hoynes is a pragmatist. To do this, he'd be the\ncraziest Vice\nPresident since Aaron Burr-and Burr shot a guy. [C.J. shrugs.] I can't\nbelieve we're\ntalking about this.\n\nC.J.\nIt's your meeting.\n\nJOSH\nI'm getting that a lot these days.\n\nC.J.\nSo... that leaves us where?\n\nJOSH\nWondering if Fitzwallace is a Democrat or a Republican.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT.

That's how we paid for it.\n\nCHARLIE\nHang on. The money I got back last year has to be paid for?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nThat's not a rebate; that's an advance.\n\nLEO\nWell, technically I guess...\n\nCHARLIE\nNot technically. This is like getting a Christmas bonus and having it deducted\nfrom your\nJanuary paycheck.\n\nLEO\nThis doesn't sound like very patriotic talk to me, Charlie. They enter\nCharlie's office.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's not. Why did you call it a rebate?\n\nLEO\nSo people would spend it. If they thought it was an advance, they might save\nit.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt was an advance.\n\nLEO\nDid you spend it?\n\nCHARLIE\nI paid my VISA bill.\n\nLEO\nWe would have preferred it if you'd ate in a restaurant or travelled.\n\nCHARLIE\nMe too.\n\nLEO\nWell, in any event... [puts out his hand]\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat? [Leo starts wiggling his fingers] Oh, what are you the collector?\n\nBARTLET\nLeo.\n\nLEO\nHe used the rebate to pay off his VISA bill.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt wasn't a rebate; it was an advance.\n\nBARTLET\nA trip to Banana Republic would have killed you? [to Leo] Let's go.\n\nBartlet and Leo walk into THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nLEO\nThe problem is we don't know anything.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's never been a problem for us before.\n\nLEO\nWe don't know anything until we can get into the tunnel, and we can't get\ninto the tunnel\nuntil the place cools down. Until we can get into the tunnel we don't know\nif we have to\nevacuate Elk Horn.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, that's FEMA's call, isn't it?\n\nLEO\nFEMA's indicated they're going to want to make it the Governor's call,\nand the Governor's\nindicated that he's going to want you to step in and...\n\nBARTLET\nI should set a ransom. I'll tell you what the radiation levels are, but\nfirst I want your\nelectoral votes. Or is that a bad strategy?\n\nLEO\nPretty bad.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, no ransom. We'll play this one straight. What about other shipments?\n\nLEO\nThere are two other shipments on the road tonight. One's low level radioactive\nwaste,\nmostly medical. It's being shipped on three rail cars in South Carolina.\n\nBARTLET\nHave we stopped the train?\n\nLEO\nYeah. The National Guard's going to secure it until we know what happened.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat about the second?\n\nLEO\nThat's more problematic. There's about 200 pounds of what's called\n\"trans-uranic\"\nmaterial from Rocky Flats where they assemble the nuclear triggers. They're\nabout 150\nmiles away from Carlsbad and we can't tell them to pull over 'cause that\nmakes them more\nvulnerable.\n\nBARTLET\nThey beefed up the escort?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nOk.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nLARRY [VO]\nNo one knew if Eisenhower was a Democrat or a Republican before he ran.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Bartlet-McGarry.\n\nLEO\nDone.\n\nJOSH\nIt's not absurd you know.\n\nLEO\nYes, it is.\n\nJOSH\nIt's not totally absurd.\n\nLEO\nYes, it is.\n\nTOBY\nHe wants your parking space.\n\nJOSH\nI really do.\n\nC.J.\nIt's not totally absurd.\n\nLEO\nYou have a good parking space.\n\nC.J.\nYou know, if it weren't for the drinking and the valium... And yet\nGrant... [Larry nods.]\n\nTOBY\nThat's right.\n\nC.J.\nAnd yet Grant. They went to Lincoln. They said, \"Grant's a drunk\". He said,\n\"Send all my\ngenerals a case of whatever he's drinking\".\n\nLARRY\nI see a 30 second spot.\n\nLEO\nYou guys don't think an alcoholic can be Vice-President?

We're looking at evacuating Elk Horn.\n\nJOSH\nElk Horn's 20 000.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWe've done this before?\n\nLEO\nFor hurricanes, yeah.\n\nJOSH\nThis is a radioactive cloud.\n\nLEO\nI wouldn't call it a cloud.\n\nJOSH\nYou wouldn't call it the end of the Yankee game either.\n\nLEO\nI don't know. You've got your sirens, route and tunnel alerts on local radio\nand TV.\nPaul Reveres go out...\n\nJOSH\nCivil defence volunteers?\n\nLEO\nYeah, we've got the armoury in Caldwell, 75 miles away for refugees.\n\nJOSH\nStill, we're talking about widespread panic and chaos, right?\n\nLEO\nI assume.

Why don't we\njust plus up the entire bill?\n\nSAM\nSir?\n\nHOYNES\nWe get our Internet for $52 million. They get to add $52 million for Internet\nblocking\nsoftware or whatever they want. Why can't we do that?\n\nSAM\nWell, one of the problems is they're deficit hogs.\n\nHOYNES\nAnd we're deficit hogs too aren't we?\n\nSAM\nThat's the other problem.\n\nHOYNES\nAll right, work with me here. What do they want? A bridge, a highway, a soda\nmachine?\nWhat do they want?\n\nSAM\nThey want your name off the bill. Sir, they want your name off of it. They\nlove this\nbill. Helping the poor learn computers so they can lift themselves up by\ntheir bootstraps\nit gets voted out of committee unanimously. But it's an election year.\n\nHOYNES\nWhen is it not an election year?

You know what I don't like, I don't\nlike that we\ncan't campaign on it.\n\nLEO\nCan you sit for a minute?\n\nHOYNES\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nI'm in a bind, and I think you know what it is.\n\nHOYNES\nI'm sorry, I don't.\n\nLEO\nI have to respect the anonymity of an alcoholic and I can't reveal what's\nsaid in a\nmeeting but I've got a responsibility to the President, and in fact to the\ncountry.\nAnd so...\n\nHOYNES\nLeo, I'm sorry, I honestly don't know what you're saying.\n\nLEO\nJohn, you've got to tell the President.\n\nHOYNES\nTell him what?\n\nLEO\nThat you're an alcoholic.\n\nHOYNES\n[in disbelief] Are you telling me he doesn't know?!\n\nLEO\nHow would he know?\n\nHOYNES\nYou didn't tell him?\n\nLEO\nOf course I didn't tell him.\n\nHOYNES\nBefore you picked me, you didn't tell him?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nHOYNES\nI... I always assumed...\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nHOYNES\nWell. Let's go see our boss.\n\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - NIGHT\nGinger seats the HUD Secretary BILL FISHER in Toby's office and goes to the\nRoosevelt\nRoom to get Toby from the meeting. Toby heads to his office.\n\nBILL FISHER\nHey.\n\nTOBY\nHow was the NGA?\n\nFISHER\nOh, you know the Governors, too many mandates, too little money. I can hear\nthat one at\nhome.\n\nTOBY\n[polite laugh] Good one.\n\nFISHER\nThe Governors liked it.\n\nTOBY\nYeah. Have you announced for the Governor of New Jersey, Bill?\n\nFISHER\nExcuse me?\n\nTOBY\nDid I miss and announcement somewhere?\n\nFISHER\nThat's three years away. I'm just trying to serve the President...\n\nTOBY\n'Cause I've never heard of these home ownership loans, so I'm assuming it's\na campaign\nproposal. Camden and Newark will go nuts but I know it's not a national\nprogram.\n\nFISHER\nGive me a break.\n\nTOBY\nYou know how I know? 'Cause national programs are announced by the President\nof the\nUnited States unless this White House passes on them first.\n\nFISHER\nToby, this is a nickel and dime program. Calm down.\n\nTOBY\nYou're right. I forgot. We're announcing a brand new replacement for Social\nSecurity\ntomorrow.\n\nFISHER\nI thought we were here to talk about...\n\nTOBY\n[raising his voice] They're not your nickels, Bill. They're not your dimes.\n\nFISHER\nWhoa! Ha on a minute. The President asked me to join his Cabinet. He asked\nme to stall my\npolitical career with the agreement that he would help me when...\n\nTOBY\nApparently you don't want his help, you're too busy helping yourself.\n\nFISHER\nIf this announcement makes page A17 of the metro section, I'd be surprised.\n\nTOBY\nThere's one name on the ballot this November, Bill. Not yours, not mine. Not\nthe Governor\nof New Jersey. And believe me no one will work harder than Jed Bartlet to\nput you there.\nBut this President looses re-election and your career's finished, and so is\nmine.\n\nFISHER\nWhat's your point?\n\nTOBY\n[sighs] Next time you announce new policy that isn't cleared by this office\nwe're\nannouncing you're moving back to New Jersey.\n\nFISHER\nWhat about the loans?\n\nTOBY\nC.J. will announce them tomorrow from the podium.\n\nFISHER\nOh, come on Toby, at least let me do it with the President.\n\nTOBY\nThis is too small for the President. I've got to go back to a meeting.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nThe President and Charlie are leaning over Charlie's computer.\n\nBARTLET\nYup. It was the rebate.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt wasn't a rebate. It was an advance.\n\nBARTLET\nYou say potato.\n\nCHARLIE\nI do say potato, and so does everybody else I know.\n\nBARTLET\nWe wanted to inject some money into retail and tourism.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy not wait until people were supposed to have the money?\n\nBARTLET\nThe economy might have improved on its own by then.\n\nCHARLIE\nIn which case the whole thing would have been pointless in the first place.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nEconomists just make it up as they go along, don't they?\n\nBARLTET\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nDid it work?\n\nBARTLET\nNot that much. Most people did what you did. They saved or they paid down\ndebt.\n\nCHARLIE\nWe don't want people save or reduce their personal debt?\n\nBARTLET\nWe do, but when the next guy's President.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou win.\n\nBARTLET\nI always do.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir. He shows Bartlet his check. Then puts it in an envelope.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll tell you what I find interesting though.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat's that sir?\n\nBARTLET\nYou. $35,000 a year, a sister to support, and you gave $1,435 to charity. I'm\nnot so\nsure that check isn't better off in your hands than ours. Oh, I'm taking\nit. Don't be\nridiculous. But when you get to your place tonight you're going to find a\nnew DVD player\nand that wimp-ass Bond movie.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nAnd I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.\n\nCHARLIE\n[smiling] That was an incredibly nice gesture.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm really something.\n\nLeo and the Vice President enter.\n\nLEO\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, John.\n\nLEO\nCan we have a minute please, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Charlie, let's get that woman on the phone. I'm feeling magical tonight.\n\nBartlet, Leo and Hoynes walk in THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're in the tunnel now and the readings don't show anything beyond the\npredictable\nlevel of background radiation. The flatbed is back on its way and the Carlsbad\nis behind\ngates so we dodged the bullet.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWe packed this stuff in 2 inches of stainless steel, 4 inches of lead. We've\nrammed it\nwith trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't going to\nprotect us from\nthe thing we haven't thought of. They took a cask out to Aberdeen Proving\nGround and shot\na TOW missile clean through it. They showed me video. What can I do for you?\n\nLEO\nSir, there's something very important we need to talk to you about.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nLEO\nWell, it's delicate and surprising, and I want to make sure your first\nreaction is\nmeasured so I'd like us to...\n\nHOYNES\nI'm a recovering alcoholic.\n\nBARTLET\nReally?\n\nHOYNES\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIs there anybody left who's not?\n\nLEO\nSir.\n\nBARTLET\nHow long?\n\nHOYNES\nI'm sorry?\n\nBARTLET\nFor how long have you been in recovery?\n\nHOYNES\nMy last drink... it was the year I was 22.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you say 22?\n\nHOYNES\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou haven't had a drink since you were 22?\n\nHOYNES\nThat's right.\n\nBARTLET\nI didn't start drinking till I was 25. What the hell do you guys count as...\n\nHOYNES\nYeah, I know, but there's a history in my family and I had a few experiences\nin college.\nI liked beer, a lot so I started going to meetings and I'm pretty sure if\nI stopped...\n\nBARTLET\nTwenty-two?\n\nHOYNES\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou and James Bond ought to team up.\n\nHOYNES\nI don't...\n\nLEO\nDon't worry about it.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's ordering a watered down martini, and Leo what the hell is this meeting\nthat's going\non all night across the hall?\n\nLEO\nWe can talk about it later.\n\nHOYNES\nIt's a meeting about having me replaced on the ticket. I know how to count\nto 270.\n\nLEO\nJohn, I assure you, I assure you, that if it were a serious notion we would...\n\nHOYNES\nTexas is gone, so is Florida.\n\nLEO\nWe're not doing it.\n\nHOYNES\nYou should think about it.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, did I hear right? Are you taking your name off that bill?\n\nHOYNES\n[forcefully] Nobody benefits from the Internet right now more than the rural\npoor.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're taking your name off. We can't campaign on it.\n\nHOYNES\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd if somebody's attacking us, you know what to do.\n\nHOYNES\nI call Leo.\n\nBARTLET\n[goes to his desk and begins to write something] Yeah, but don't discount\nthe possibility\nthat it might be Leo.\n\nHOYNES\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nJohn, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've\nalways liked you\na little more than you thought I did, but that's not why you're staying. It's\nthis.\n[hands Hoynes a piece of paper] Four words.\n\nHoynes reads the paper, looks at the President and hands the paper to Leo.\n\nHOYNES\nI've always liked you more than you thought I did too, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nJust a little, right?\n\nHOYNES\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nMe, too. Anything else?\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nHOYNES\nThank you, sir.\n\nLeo and Hoynes head into Leo's office.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie!\n\nCHARLIE\n[enters] Yes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go. I'm a magic man.\n\nCharlie leaves and returns with Donna.\n\nBARTLET\n[with Italian accent] Donnatella.\n\nDONNA\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nTell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish Brigadier General who vanquished\nthe Russian\nand Prussian military then came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry\nduring the\nAmerican revolution.\n\nDONNA\n[turning to leave] I will, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIt says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that\nin the '60s\nwhen the Madison Superintendent of Schools banned Twelfth Night for reasons\npassing\nunderstanding, a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her house on\nSaturdays to\nread it.\n\nDONNA\nI didn't know that sir. Josh wrote you a memo on Molly Morello?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah 'cause all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho. It says she came\nin two hours\nearly to teach an AP English class she developed herself because the school\ndidn't offer\none.\n\nDONNA\nI was in that class.\n\nBARTLET\nSounds like she deserves a proclamation. I wish I could give her one, but\nI can't.\n\nDONNA\nI totally understand.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's just too much inside baseball, you know?\n\nDONNA\nYou're very nice to even talk to me about it.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nThe magic man thing works a lot better when you pick up on the signals,\nTonto. What's\nthat you say? There's a phone call for Donna?\n\nDonna looks shocked as Bartlet hits the speakerphone.\n\nBARTLET\nGood evening, this is the White House, for whom are you holding?\n\nMRS. MORELLO\n[on the phone] I'm holding for Donna Moss. This is Mrs. Morello.\n\nDONNA\n[whispering] Oh my God.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nDonna?\n\nDONNA\nMrs. Morello, it's me.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nIs everything all right?\n\nDONNA\nEverything's fine.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nI hadn't heard from you in such a long time so I thought...\n\nDONNA\nNo everything's fine. Sally Seidelman told me you were retiring.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nAt the end of this year.\n\nDONNA\nWell, I... I just wanted to say. I don't know, I just... I just wanted to\nsay...\nI don't know.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nAre--Are you sure everything's all right?\n\nBARTLET\n[whispering] Tell her where you are.\n\nDONNA\nMrs. Morello, I'm in the Oval Office with the President of the United States\nand it's\nbecause of you. [silence] Mrs. Morello?\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nWhat a thing to say. Well, we're all very proud of you, Donna.\n\nBARTLET\n[grouchily] She didn't do anything.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nWas that...?\n\nBARTLET\nIt's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello. I've got a few questions. When you taught\nBeowulf, did\nyou make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a\ntranslation?\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nWe used a translation, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. We're going to call that the James Bond version.\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat are you planning on doing with your retirement?\n\nMRS. MORELLO\nMy husband and I are going to travel a little.\n\nBARTLET\nI'd stay away from the Elk Horn area of Idaho for a little while. You'll\nread why in the\nmorning. Let's talk about Twelfth Night.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nC.J.\nTwenty-two?\n\nHOYNES\nYup.\n\nC.J.\nYou haven't' had a drink since you were 22?\n\nHOYNES\nThat's right.\n\nC.J.\nUlysses S. Grant would have slapped your face.\n\nHOYNES\nHe did once.\n\nJOSH\nListen, it's fine that this is funny and Mr. Vice President I couldn't care\nless, but\nwhat about the campaign?\n\nLEO\nWhat about it?\n\nJOSH\nThe President just got passed an honesty issue.\n\nTOBY\nHe's not passed it.\n\nJOSH\nIf it becomes public...\n\nC.J.\nThat's a big assumption.\n\nTOBY\nNo it's not.\n\nLEO\nI think that issue is probably worth further discussion but we're done\ntalking about the\nticket. The President's made it very clear that he wants the Vice President\nto remain the\nVice President and he wrote down his one and only reason.\n\nHe pulls out the paper and hands it to Josh.\n\nJOSH\n\"Because I could die.\" Well, of course he's right, sir.\n\nHOYNES\nIt doesn't solve the problem of the electoral math. I don't know what the\nfield's going\nto look like after Labor Day. The Etch-A-Sketch will be shaken up a little,\nbut right now\nthe math's tough. And I know right now you all think he's a punch line and\nI know why,\nbut I disagree. They're sure running the right guy against us.\n\nSAM\nAm I really the only one who thinks a giant sumo wrestler in a hockey goal\nmight get the\njob done?\n\nJOSH\nI don't know. I'm open to new ideas.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\nC.J., Sam, Toby, and a few people are inside.\n\nSAM\nYou want to make it clear that we're pushing for Slovenia and possibly the\nBaltic\nstates. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania.\n\nC.J.\nNot Fredonia? We're going to leave Fredonia out there?\n\nTOBY\nThe point is, the zero option's off the table.\n\nC.J.\nHooray for Captain Spalding...\n\nTOBY\nCan we please?\n\nC.J.\nHey, aren't we pretty much admitting all the countries we formed NATO to\nfight?\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nThen why not dissolve it?\n\nTOBY\nWe like the bomber jackets.\n\nCarol approaches from outside.\n\nC.J.\n[to Toby] See, when you make a joke...\n\nTOBY\nMy jokes are funny.\n\nC.J.\nFredonia was pretty good.\n\nTOBY\nHeard it.\n\nCarol passes papers to C.J.. Ginger comes in with a coffee cup for Sam.\n\nC.J.\n[to Toby] I'll give you $500 if you perform \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\" at\nthis year's Gridiron.\n\nSAM\n[to Toby] She's got to get in there. Can we talk about sugar subsidies?\n\nTOBY\nWe're not done talking about the summit!\n\nSAM\nIt's a two-day grip and grin.\n\nTOBY\nAnd, you know, you of all people... the Russians finally elect a reformer,\nand you still...\n\nSAM\n20 years in the KGB, an election that will make Tammy Hall look like the\nLeague of\nWoman Voters... I'm not sure that qualifies as a...

Carol follows,\nToby and Sam\nstay behind.\n\nC.J.\nGood morning!\n\nREPORTERS\nGood morning!\n\nC.J.\nI have some scheduled details on the summit. Air Force One will depart\nAndrews at\n7pm Friday, arriving at Helsinki 4am Eastern time, that's 11am Saturday\nlocal.\nPresidents Bartlet and Chigorin will have their first meeting at three\no'clock at\nMantyniemi - that's change, photo op, stills only, at the beginning of the\nmeeting.\n\nKATIE\nC.J.? What does the President see as the goals of the summit?\n\nC.J.\nWell, first to meet the new Russian president, but they show the aspiration\nof\nbuilding a secure and undivided Europe.\n\nSTEVE\nC.J., are you aware of the fire that happened at King Fatah Middle School?\n\nC.J.\nYeah, that's a tragedy. Chris?\n\nCHRIS\nSaudi news is reporting that rescuers were prevented from getting to several\nfemale\nstudents by religious police.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, I read that too. Steve.\n\nCHRIS\nDoes the White House have a comment?\n\nC.J.\nI literally just got this a minute and a half ago.

I'm barely surprised. This is a country where women aren't\nallowed\nto drive a car. They're not allowed to be in the company of any man other\nthan a close\nrelative, they're required to adhere to a dress code that would make the\nMaryknoll Nun\nlook like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded 121 people last year for robbery,\nrape, and drug\ntrafficking, they've no free press, no elected government, no political\nparties, and\nthe royal family allows the religious police to travel in groups of six,\ncarrying\nnightsticks and they freely and publicly beat women. But \"Brutus is an\nhonorable man.\"\nSeventeen schoolgirls were forced to burn alive because they weren't wearing\nthe proper\nclothing. Am I outraged? No, Steve. No Chris. No, Mark.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY\nSam is inside taking papers from Ginger as Charlie walks in.\n\nCHARLIE\nSam, you know a guy named Farley who worked here before I did?\n\nSAM\nWhere did he work?\n\nCHARLIE\nHe worked for the President.\n\nSAM\nNo. What's his first name?\n\nCHARLIE\nI don't know. A kid wrote a letter to the President saying that when he was\ngovernor\nand campaigning, that he met his assistant Mr. Farley.\n\nThey walk up to SAM'S OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nIt's probably one of the guys early on. I didn't know any of them.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah, except it couldn't have been from that early on, 'cause the kid says\nthey met\nwhen his father took him to the speech about the budget in Pittsburgh.\n\nSAM\n[walks out] You mean San-Diego.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe says Pittsburgh.\n\nSAM\n[taking more papers from Ginger] We never did a budget speech in Pittsburgh.\n\nCHARLIE\nThis is a little weird.\n\nSAM\nWell, how many weird letters does the President get a day?\n\nCHARLIE\n[follows Sam around] Couple of thousand, but this one had the President\nprivate\nmail code on it, that's why I got it.\n\nSAM\nWell, how many confused people does the President befriend every day?\n\nCHARLIE\nCouple of dozen, but he doesn't give them the private mail code.They stop\nin front\nof the Roosevelt Room.\n\nSAM\nI don't know. I'm on with the Russians.\n\nCharlie walks off, Sam opens the door to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. There are two\nmen inside.\n\nSAM\nGood morning, I'm Sam Seaborn.\n\nNIKOLAI IVANOVICH\nNikolai Ivanovich.\n\nGEORGE KOZLOWSKI\nGeorge Kozlowski.\n\nSAM\n[shakes their hands] Thanks for coming by. This should be quick.\n\nThey settle around the table, Sam opposite the two Russians.\n\nSAM\nLet me first say that President Bartlet is looking forward to meeting with\nPresident\nChigorin and having a mutually productive meeting.\n\nKOZLOWSKI\nMr. Seaborn, uh, we understood that the protocol arrangements have been... have\nbeen\nfinalized by the... by the advance teams in Helsinki.\n\nSAM\nThat's right, but there are points I'd like to revisit. My thinking being -\nI could\nrelay my concerns to you at the embassy and you could send them on to Moscow\nand\nhopefully, get an answer quickly 'cause we're coming down with it now.\n\nKOZLOWSKI\nI'm sorry, I... uh...\n\nSAM\nIt's coming up quickly. The summit, it's Saturday, and this is Monday.\n\nKOZLOWSKI\nAh, yes, yes.\n\nSAM\nWe've agreed to a consecutive translation?\n\nIVANOVICH\nYes.\n\nSAM\nI'd like to change that to a simultaneous translation.\n\nIVANOVICH\nThey prefer that the two leaders pause while their remarks\nare... rendered? Rendered\ninto their particular language.\n\nSAM\nPresident Bartlet has a rhythm to his speaking pattern, and it's best if it's\nuninterrupted. That's the only reason I bring it up.\n\nIVANOVICH\nWe'll pass that on.\n\nSAM\nI'm sorry, pass it on?\n\nIVANOVICH\nYes.\n\nSAM\n[smiles uncertainly] I'm sorry, it's just that one is good and one is\nbad. We'd already\nagreed on the Grand Salon in Finlandia Hall for the 6:00 meeting and I wanted\nto change\nthat to the Hall of Flags.\n\nIVANOVICH\nHall of Flags. Didn't we agree 3:00 for that meeting?\n\nSAM\nIt's funny you should mention that.\n\nIVANOVICH\nI'm sorry?\n\nSAM\nIt's funny... [thinks about his choice of words] It's a coincidence that\nyou should happen\nto mention the time of the meeting. See, President Chigorin only has to fly\nthrough one\ntime zone. President Bartlet has to fly through seven. Don't get me wrong,\nthis President\ncan do three shows a night, but there's no one in the Western Hemisphere\nwho has a worse\nreaction to jetlag than he does. Any trip 8 hours or longer and someone gets\nfired at the\nend of it, and it's already been me three times, so...\n\nIVANOVICH\nWe'll pass it on.\n\nSAM\nI think everyone on the White House staff would agree when I say that one\nis a deal-breaker.\n\nIVANOVICH\nAll right, then. Was there anything else?\n\nSAM\nOh, yeah, we're just getting started. You guys hungry?\n\nIVANOVICH\nNo.\n\nSAM\n[flips notepad open] Okay.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

They're very angry faxes.\n\nDONNA\nFrom Saudis?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nWell, what did you expect?\n\nC.J.\nVery angry faxes from Saudis and angry e-mails. Look at these.\n\nC.J. points to her laptop, and Donna sits at her desk to read off the screen.\n\nDONNA\nI'm seeing some troubling spelling here. 'Godless' with two \"d's.\"\n\nC.J.\n[takes her purse] Let's go.\n\nDONNA\nHang on. C.J....\n\nC.J.\nI saw it.\n\nDONNA\nIt's a death threat.\n\nC.J.\nIt's not a big deal.\n\nDONNA\nYou sure?\n\nC.J.\nYeah. Don't tell anybody, okay, I don't want a lot of production.\n\nDONNA\nAll right.\n\nC.J.\nThanks.\n\nDONNA\n[shouts] Josh! Can you come in here an look at this, please?\n\nC.J.\nDonna?!\n\nDonna makes a face at her. Josh pops by at the door.\n\nJOSH\nLook at what?\n\nDONNA\nC.J.'s e-mail.\n\nJosh looks at the e-mail. C.J. waits impatiently.\n\nJOSH\nCall Frank Tenney downstairs. Tell him I want to talk to him right away.\n\nDONNA\nYeah. [runs off]\n\nC.J.\nYou take this seriously?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, it's a death threat, C.J., I take it seriously. [stands up] I had some\nexperience with this. [walks out]\n\nCUT TO: INT.

This is\nBushehr, and this is what looks to me like the early days of construction\nof a light\nwater reactor. Light water is... ordinary water, sir, it's tap water. It's\nPerrier.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nLight water is what's used for nuclear reactors and the Iranians have\ncontracted the\nRussians to build them a light water reactor for that purpose.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's the problem?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nFour intelligence agencies are telling me I'm wrong, and I am. The Russians\nare building\nthem a heavy water reactor.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do you use heavy water for?\n\nLEO\nPlutonium.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT ONE\n* * *\n\nACT TWO\n\nFADE IN: INT.

You don't ban those who supported you opponent, you make\nthem wallow\nin their losedom by covering your victory. You sit them in the front row. You\ngive\nthem a hat!

I'm just talking. [They laugh.] Listen, you're already credentialed\nto cover\nour President, it's just a matter of putting you on a plane and, before I\ndo that,\nI want to check with the State department to make sure it's not a grotesquely\ninsulting\nthing to do to a new President from whom the US is hoping for quite a bit.\n\nKOSS\nOh, so your first amendment only extends as far as it's polite?\n\nTOBY\nNo, it extends farther then that but it only protects us. Believe me, if we\nwere able to\ninforce US law around the world, I'd retire and go scuba-diving.\n\nKOSS\nYou like diving?\n\nTOBY\nI've never done it. I've... never done anything, but I've seen pictures and\nit looks fun.\nI've seen pictures of people out there in the world, and they all look like\nthey're glad\nthey are. Now, granted, when I'm looking at these pictures, somebody's\nusually trying to\nsell me something, but tell you what: I'm 44 years old and I'm buying. I\nusually don't\ntalk this much, but I'm having an odd day. Want to stay for a little and\nlook at pictures\nof scuba-diving?\n\nKOSS\nNo, thank you.\n\nTOBY\n[stands up] Okay, then.

[to Leo] Yeah, we can't do it.\n\nLEO\nHow did it go over there?\n\nJOSH\nWell, they confronted the RussiansAtomic Energy Minister with the photographs.\n\nLEO\nAnd?\n\nJOSH\nHe denies everything.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's good enough for me.\n\nJOSH\nHe doesn't deny that they're building a reactor; they've had contracts with\nIran since\n'76 and he says that Deuterium-based reactors had been up and running in\nCanada for years.\n\nThey walk back into THE OVAL OFFICE. Fitzwallace is standing in it.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, Canada, Russia - roughly the same relationship with the US. Fitz,\nyou old horse\nthief, you old muckety-muck!\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWell, good morning again, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nJosh says the director of MinAtom says it's commercial power production.\n\nFITZWALLACE\n[as they both sit] Yeah, except that there are no power lines to and from\nthe site.\nAnd there's no reprocessing facility. This one's 50 megawatts thermal,\nwhich is identical\nto the reactor Pakistan's got in Kushab. This isn't used to make the lights\ngo; it's used\nto make plutonium. Mr. President, I'm not your National Security Advisor,\nor your Secretary\nof Defense or State. But the Russians are giving Iran the bomb.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, that's what was said by my National Security Advisor twenty minutes ago,\nright after\nit was said by the Secretaries of State and Defense. And, for what it's worth,\nthe directors\nof the CIA, NSA, FBI and Naval Intelligence.\n\nJOSH\nLeo, isn't MinAtom in terrible shape?\n\nLEO\nIt lost some customers after Chernobyl.\n\nJOSH\n[sits] Yeah, that's 'welcome to free markets the hard way,' but my point is\nthe light water\nreactor contracts are way behind schedule, there are all kinds of technical\nfailures.\n\nBARTLET\nYou think the Iranians forced them to build them a heavy water reactor?\n\nJOSH\nTo satisfy the contracts, maybe.\n\nBARTLET\nCrap. And even if that were the case, it doesn't make them Jean Valjean. They\nwant to power\nbroker in the Middle East. Just what the doctor ordered for the Middle East.\n\nBartlet stands up, and everyone else stands as well.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, while avoiding the biggest diplomacy disaster since I don't know\nwhen -\nJosh, Leo, you guys have to figure out a way to get me out of it.\n\nJOSH\nGet him out of what?\n\nLEO\nHe's not going to Helsinki.

Toby hastily closes his door.\n\nTOBY\nI'm sorry, what did you say?\n\nMAN\nI'm sorry about that. I ask because...\n\nTOBY\nYeah. I mean, I wanted to talk to you because I'd been asked to put a reporter\nfrom\nthe Novaya Gazeta on the press plane.\n\nMAN\nThat's a mistake.\n\nTOBY\nYou understand I'm talking about a pencil and pad of paper, from which no\none has ever died.\n\nMAN\nYou understand there isn't a paper or any publication in Russia that is more\ncritical\nof the Chigorin government.\n\nTOBY\nWell, the editorial judgement aside, what's the damage assessment?\n\nMAN\nWell, the point of the summit is to build strong bilateral ties with the new\nadministration, so...\n\nTOBY\nWe make it clear it's not personal.\n\nMAN\nHow do you suggest we do that?\n\nTOBY\nI don't know... What are the things I can do?\n\nMAN\nWe've got about half a dozen American reporters in Moscow whose credentials\nare pending.\nToby, this is like if they credentialed the Enquirer to cover the summit!\n\nTOBY\nIf the Enquirer asked us, we'd credential them.

With all your years of training and experience in sniffing\nout crime,\nyour opinion really carries a lot of weight with me.\n\nC.J.\nI don't want to appear fragile.\n\nBARTLET\nAre you kidding?\n\nC.J.\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nWe're talking about one bodyguard. I have twelve, and that's before I leave\nthe house.\nYou ever count the number of guns that come along with me when Abbey and I\ntake in a\nplay at the Kennedy Center? Do I seem fragile to you?\n\nC.J.\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThen...\n\nC.J.\nYou're also not a woman in a man's job. To say nothing of the fact that\nyou're required\nby law to be protected by the Treasury Department. You don't have a choice.

And\nit's 'cause\nhe discovered it's better for long-term growth. [sits down to read]\n\nTOBY\nThe journal probably wrote an editorial about his broken promises too.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, I should be able to reference that speech. When did he give that? It\nwas in the\nindustrial North East.\n\nTOBY\nPittsburgh, PA.\n\nCharlie is just on his way out when he hears this.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932 in Pittsburgh, can you get your\nhands on a copy?\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm sorry, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI said, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932...\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.

What do you want from my life? The\ngovernment\ncan't be in the business of cosigning loans.\n\nLEO\nWe wouldn't be handing them a bag of unmarked bills, just backing the loans\nto cover\nthe cost of the recall.\n\nBARTLET\n[stands up] It's a subsidy.\n\nLEO\nIt's a small one!\n\nBARTLET\nI'm an economist!\n\nLEO\nSir! This was not a failure of business, it was... I don't know, it was a\nmistake,\nit was human error, and Jake's been completely forth...\n\nBARTLET\nThe marketplace will take care of Antares.\n\nLEO\nThe marketplace will kill Antares.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's what's supposed to happen.\n\nLEO\nIt's not like it's unprecedented, sir. We helped out steel.\n\nBARTLET\nThat was an industry that was hurt by unfair trade practices. Antares was\nhurt by their\nown carelessness.\n\nLEO\nA loan guarantee doesn't cost the taxpayers a nickel.\n\nBARTLET\nUnless they go under and either way they've just said 'We're open for\nbusiness.'\n\nLEO\nFor a corporate icon that feeds into tech companies, computers, aerospace. The\nripple\neffects, workers losing jobs, it's a blue chip stock that's in every major...\n\nBARTLET\n[shouts] They were huge contributors! How the hell am I supposed... They\nwere huge contributors!\n\nLEO\nCarelessness doesn't have to exist for a mistake to be made.\n\nBARTLET\n[sits at his desk] What?\n\nLEO\nYou said it was carelessness and I don't believe carelessness has to exist\nfor a mistake\nto be made. Jake was a contributor, and he's never asked for a favor, not\neven now.\nHe was a contributor 'cause he knows us, and we know him, and we know,\nthat if a mistake\nhappened in design or production at Antares it wasn't shoddy... it wasn't\non the cheek.\nYou know how many chips have acted up so far? One. Dollars to donuts, he\ncould have gotten\naway with it. But he wanted to warn people they may have a problem before... I\ndon't even\nknow what happens when 80 million computers stop working right. But tell me\nthis isn't\nexactly how we want American business to behave! I know it doesn't look good,\nhe's a\nfriend of ours. But there is a reason he's a friend of ours.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're announcing end of business tomorrow?\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\n[sighs] I'm not saying anything, but grab some people and put together some\nnumbers.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm not saying anything.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nLeo walks out of the office.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT.

It was a pleasure doing business with you.\n\nKOZLOWSKI\nUh... we have one more.\n\nSAM\nName it!\n\nKOZLOWSKI\nOn the issue of the language in the joint statement.\n\nSAM\nWell, I can't negotiate language of the statement.\n\nIVANOVICH\nIt's just a suggestion.\n\nSAM\nThe language has been worked out with the State, Commerce, and Defense,\nit's way...\n\nIVANOVICH\nWill you hear suggestion, Sam?\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nIVANOVICH\n[clears throat, reads] \"Both President Chigorin and myself agree that we\nmust enter 21st\ncentury as partners and friends, not as adversaries. We must lead way and\nstem in tide\nof nuclear proliferation and we must start with ourselves, for why should\ntwo nations\nstill possess power to destroy each other ten times over; surely, once is\nenough.\"\n\nSAM\nWhose idea was this?\n\nIVANOVICH\nMine.\n\nSAM\nWho wrote it?\n\nIVANOVICH\nI did. [hands him the notes] You will, uh... pass it up?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nIVANOVICH\nThat's good one, yes?\n\nSAM\nYes. Thank you.\n\nCUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY\nLudmila Koss enters.\n\nKOSS\nHello.\n\nTOBY\nHello.\n\nToby points to the couch and picks up papers from his desk.\n\nTOBY\nHere are your credentials for the plane, here's your plane ticket, here are\nyour\ncredentials for the Palace, the Saturday press conference, the Arctic Peoples\nexhibit,\nthe Sunday press conference, and the Hall of Flags.\n\nKOSS\nThank you very much.\n\nTOBY\nEither way, I found out why Chigorin and his people have such a problem with\nyou.\n\nKOSS\nIt's because I don't flatter them.\n\nTOBY\nNo, it's because you stink.\n\nKOSS\nI beg your pardon?\n\nTOBY\nYou can beg all you want, you're not gonna get it. Last month, you alleged\nthat the\nChigorin government bombed several apartment buildings based on an unattributed\nsource.\nIt was refuted; you never retracted!\n\nKOSS\nThe government's case was all over the television!\n\nTOBY\n[holds up a printout] Last week, you had a cover story about President\nChigorin's\nmother-in-law moving closer to the Kremlin. You printed her home address,\nshe had to relocate.\n\nKOSS\n[stands up] Well, that's her decision.\n\nTOBY\nYou reported the failing grades of the Defense Minister's twelve-year-old\nson! Does that\neven count as journalism? Does that do anything but bring ridicule on a\ndefenseless kid?\nWe've got people like you here, on cable and on the Internet, and there's\nno one anywhere\non the ideological spectrum that doesn't roll their eyes when their names\nare spoken out\nloud. You know, we've always had free press here, we take it for granted... how\ncan you\n[crumples the paper] treat it like this?! You should give up your space and\nput another\nnaked woman in there! [beat] Anyway. Here are your credentials.\n\nToby throws them on the desk. Koss picks them up and leaves.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nSeveral people including Fitz, Josh, Leo, and Bartlet are inside.\n\nLEO\nThe Majority Leader moves up HMO reform.\n\nBARTLET\nHe'll do that?\n\nLEO\nWe've talked to him. He's moved up HMO reform, there's nothing we can do\nabout it,\nand the welfare of your people comes first.\n\nSam walks inside. Josh approaches him and reads what Sam gives him.\n\nWOMAN\nHe has a Duma, he'll understand.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThis makes sense.\n\nLEO\nWe save face and send a strong message.\n\nBARTLET\nAnybody? Can I use this to get out of weddings and stuff? [sits down] Sam,\nthe Majority\nLeader's gonna move up HMO reform and my Duma's gonna vote on it, what do\nyou think?\n\nJOSH\nSorry, sir, would you hear what Sam has to say for a moment?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nSAM\n[walks forward with the note] Listen, I'd like to tell you about something\nand if, when\nI'm done, you think I sounded like an idiot, just know that I'll be feeling\nlike one as\nwell. Nikolai Ivanovich, the senior member of the logistical negotiating team,\nsaid he\nhad language he wanted added to the joint statement, and that he wrote it\nhimself.\n\nLEO\nWhat's he getting involved with the language of the statement for?\n\nSAM\nYeah. [opens the note] What he wanted added was, \"Together in partnership,\nwe must stem\nthe tide of nuclear proliferation, for why should our two nations still\npossess the power\nto destroy themselves ten times over; surely once is enough.\" Now, I have\nto tell you,\nsir, that both these negotiators had conversational English, but they didn't\nhave idioms.\nI promise you...\n\nBARTLET\n'Stem the tide\" is an English idiom.\n\nSAM\nYeah, and they don't have 'surely, once is enough' either.\n\nJOSH\nSir, Chigorin wrote that.\n\nSAM\nI think he's trying to send you a message, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nHe is trying to send me a message.\n\nEVERYONE\nExactly, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\n[stands up] We've been trying to get non-proliferation on the agenda, we've\nbeen trying\nto put those exact words in Chigorin's mouth.\n\nJOSH\nHe's got the whole Soviet defense establishment that's trying to do business.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWait a second! Hang on... You're telling me that foreign policy of this\nmagnitude is\nconducted through Sam and I'm still alive?\n\nSAM\nWe're pretty impressed ourselves, Mr. Chairman.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWhy didn't he just have somebody pick up the phone?\n\nJOSH\nIt's the old diplomatic corps, and he can't trust them yet, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nFitz?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nI think he's going out on a limb. [stands up] I think you should meet him\nthere.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go to Helsinki. But the reactor's first thing on the agenda. Anybody?\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks, everyone! Thank you. Thanks!\n\nThe people begin to leave.\n\nLEO\nI've got Jake Kimball in my office.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll be right in. Sam!\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nNice job.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nBARTLET\nTell me again why I can't wear whatever the hell I want?\n\nSAM\nWell, that's not entirely true, sir: the earmuffs are optional.\n\nBARTLET\nI probably won't be wearing them.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir. [leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nBartlet walks inside.\n\nBARTLET\nWhatever happened to Pong, huh? It was great, it was relaxing, it had that\nvery\nsatisfying sound?\n\nJAKE KIMBALL\nI, uh... I don't know, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, me neither. Leo?\n\nLeo hands him a note, Bartlet reads it.\n\nBARTLET\nNo. Leo wanted to see if we could guarantee a loan.\n\nJAKE\nI didn't know that. I can't ask you for that.\n\nBARTLET\nI appreciate that, and I can't give it to you, but I think I can do Leo one\nbetter.\n\nLEO\nWhat?\n\nBARTLET\nWe'll stay his biggest customer. When you announce your recall, you can\nannounce you're\nkeeping your government contracts. Leo will work it out with Congress.\n\nJAKE\n[overwhelmed] That's very generous, Mr. President. I appreciate your\nconfidence.\n\nBARTLET\nTalk to me about the 75 thousand workers.\n\nJAKE\nI won't be taking any salary for two years and my managers will cut their\nsalaries by\n50 percent before we even consider laying anyone off.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. Jakie, this is the White House, if we only screw up twice before\nbreakfast,\nit was a very good morning.\n\nJAKE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nOne more thing: you can't make any more campaign contributions to me, or\nany Democrat.\nYou can vote, but that's it.\n\nJAKE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI knew I'd get screwed by a computer one day. [Leo smiles.] I have an\nimportant photo op,\nexcuse me. [leaves abruptly]\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY\nCharlie is inside when an old man is seen through the door.\n\nNANCY\nCharlie.\n\nCharlie comes out.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. Tatum?\n\nDR. TED TATUM\nI'm Doctor Tatum, I'm the one you talked to on the phone. [They shake hands.]\nThis is my father.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm Charlie Young. I'm personal aide to the President.\n\nALAN TATUM\nYes?\n\nCHARLIE\nYou didn't tell him anything, right?\n\nDR. TATUM\nHe thinks we're on Candid Camera.\n\nTATUM\nOr that this is a ruse of some kind. What the...\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's not a ruse. [Nancy hands him papers.] When you were nine, you wrote\nthis letter to\nFranklin Roosevelt. You met him when he was governor of New York, and a\ncandidate for\nPresident.\n\nTATUM\nWell, I'll be damned.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou met his personal aide, Tom Farley. That's me. Mr. Tatum, by any chance,\nthe apartment\nwhere you grew up in Pittsburgh, was it 2345 Northern...\n\nTATUM\n... State Boulevard.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes. That's the only residential building in Pittsburgh that's been torn\ndown recently.\nIn fact, it was just two weeks ago. Somebody found your letter and put the\nright postage on it.\n\nTATUM\nWell, would you look at what people do!\n\nCHARLIE\nI tell you, none of it would have happened, except there's a five-digit code\nthat\nPresidents give out to close friends, and President Bartlet copied his from\nFDR.\n\nBARTLET\n[approaches from behind] For the hundredth time, it was an homage!\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBartlet shakes hands with Tatum.\n\nBARTLET\nAlan Tatum?\n\nTATUM\nYes, sir!\n\nBARTLET\nThe White House owes you one picture.\n\nTATUM\nOh, my!\n\nDR. TATUM\nLet's go, Dad.\n\nTATUM\nOh, Mr. President, this is my son, Ted.\n\nBARTLET\n[as they shake hands] Good to meet you!\n\nTATUM\nHe's a doctor.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry. I'm married to one. No, you meant that as a good thing! Let's go.\n\nThey walk into THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nBARTLET\nFDR was a fine president, don't get me wrong, but if you want something done\nright,\ndammit, call New Hampshire! Come in, please.\n\nThe Tatums enter and stand next to Bartlet as a photographer takes pictures.\n\nBARTLET\nAre you retired, Mr. Tatum?\n\nTATUM\nYes, sir, 53 years on the Spirit of St. Louis. New York to St. Louis.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Dr. Tatum] Your grandfather was a furnace worker. Your father was on a\nrailroad.\nYou couldn't find an honest work?\n\nTATUM\nI'd like my picture taken with that young man, if you don't mind.\n\nBARTLET\nCharlie! [motions for him to come over]\n\nCharlie steps into the picture as Bartlet walks out and more shots are taken.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHER\nThank you.\n\nTATUM\n[shakes hands with Charlie] Thank you.\n\nDR. TATUM\nWell, thank you very much, sir. This was really a once-in-a-lifetime experience\nfor both of us.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere are you going? You got pictures, what do you I get?\n\nTATUM\nI don't know what...\n\nBARTLET\nYou were there, you were at his feet, you got to tell me everything! Sit,\nwe're going to\nget some food. [to Dr. Tatum] You sit quietly over there and try to resist\ntemptation to\nbill me for something.\n\nDr. Tatum laughs, as everyone sits down.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BULLPEN AREA TO C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nC.J. walks through to her office and sees an Agent standing in the doorway.\nShe slides past him inside.\n\nC.J.\nHello.\n\nSPECIAL AGENT SIMON DONOVAN\nC.J. Cregg?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSIMON\nSpecial Agent Simon Donovan. I'm with the Treasury Department.\n\nC.J.\nAha. What branch of the Treasury Department, Agent Donovan?\n\nSIMON\n[shows her a badge] U.S. Secret Service. I don't like flashing it around,\nit gives some\npeople the jumps. But Agent Butterfield said you were a reluctant customer.\n\nC.J.\nHow does this work?\n\nSIMON\nWhat is it you'd like to know?\n\nC.J.\nWell, first of all, from how far away can you do this?\n\nSIMON\nI can respect a certain perimeter of privacy.\n\nC.J.\nWhat does that mean?\n\nSIMON\nI don't need to see you naked or anything.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nSIMON\nThough, 'better safe then sorry' is a bit of a motto for us at the Treasury. I\ndon't know,\nyou're the boss. I'll be leading a detail of four agents each working a\nthird of the day,\none day off a week. We'll set up a command post in your apartment building,\nset up\nsurveillance, you can put your car in a garage, you'll be using ours.\n\nCarol walks in with some papers and leaves. C.J. walks out of her office,\nSimon follows.\n\nC.J.\nYou can't come in the Briefing Room.\n\nSIMON\nA crowded room where anyone can get credentialed and you're up at the podium?\nNo, I'm pretty sure I'll be there.\n\nC.J.\nThis is what you meant by I am the boss?\n\nSIMON\nUh... yeah, I guess it's more of an honorary thing.\n\nC.J. tries to open a door, Simon closes it in front of her.\n\nSIMON\nThis guy isn't small-time, Ms. Cregg. You're being hunted. By the way,\nI can't guarantee\nanything except to say that if you're dead, chances are I am, too.\n\nC.J.\nWell, I guess it's gonna have to be the little things now.\n\nSIMON\nYeah. I'll check in with my command.\n\nSimon leaves, as C.J. enters the next room, looking back at him.

THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\nToby walks down a hallway then into the Roosevelt Room where media directors\nare waiting.\n\nTOBY\nMorning.\n\nMEDIA DIRECTORS\nGood morning.\n\nTOBY\nListen, I've got an idea for a new kind of awards show, you should tell your\nentertainment\ndivisions about this. At the moment the winner's name is called the four\nnominees who\ndidn't win drop through a trap door right under their seats. Am I crazy,\nor is that not\npretty good television?\n\nThey all chuckle.\n\nMAN\nSpeaking of good television...\n\nTOBY\nYes, I've been asked by Bruno Gianelli to apologize for the skyboxes in\nMiami. We'll do\nbetter at the Garden.\n\nMAN\nWell what about spinners? Last time you were all staffing the president and\nthere was no\none to speak to during the big speeches.\n\nTOBY\nWe've got a better surrogate program this time. Governors, some of the big\nmayors,\nsome of us will be available to you, and some of us still have to staff the\npresident.\n\nWOMAN\nWe directly come to you if we need more floor passes?\n\nTOBY\nAbsolutely.\n\nMAN\nWe really should be talking about programming.\n\nTOBY\nWe have to?\n\nMAN\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nAnd we have to call it programming?\n\nMAN\nCall it what you like, we call it programming.\n\nTOBY\nThe panels were a little dry last time.\n\nMAN\nTwo panels on deficit reduction.\n\nTOBY\nMonday night we've got real people. The president's met across the country\nreading\nplanks from the platform. Scott O'Leary's doing the keynote. The Harlem Boys'\nChoir\nis singing the National Anthem. Tuesday is Mrs. Bartlet and Rev. Lydell. We've\ngot a\npanel with women senators on biomedical research, breast cancer breakthroughs,\nmedical\nprivacy issues... Look, uh, a Dean Martin roast it ain't, but...\n\nMAN\nWe're thinking about cutting back on our coverage.\n\nTOBY\nYou only covered two hours a night last time. How much more can you...?\n\nMAN\nWe're talking about an hour.\n\nTOBY\n[laughing] You can't do an hour a night, that's just...\n\nMAN\nSee you don't understand. We're talking about an hour for each convention. We\ncover the\nacceptance speeches, that's it.\n\nTOBY\nOne of these times you guys are going to come in here and say that and it's\ngoing to be true.\n\nThe media directors look at him seriously.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nLeo and the President are walking down the hallway.\n\nLEO\nHow long is it?\n\nBARTLET\nFour or five hours, maybe, you'll be fine.\n\nLEO\nThey do all the Henrys?\n\nBARTLET\nThey take all the Henrys.

We have a credible threat.\n\nBARTLET\nWe just got done with Helsinki and the reactor.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYes, sir\n\nBARTLET\nHow do we know?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe NSA's been monitoring web sites of the Bahji cell operating out of\nSyria. They've\nbeen looking for pictures codes and they intercepted cellular calls.\n\nMAN\nSir, that tracks with what our advisors in Kazakhstan gave us earlier this\nmorning.\nAnd the Russians are holding a prisoner in Chechnya who verified it will be\nmilitary.\n\nLEO\nWhich are the most vulnerable?\n\nMAN\nThe Navy's fifth fleet in Bahrain, Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, Prince Sultan\nAir Base,\nIncirlik, Seeb North Air Base.\n\nBARTLET\nGeneral?\n\nGENERAL\nI'd like to order Force Protection Delta for all bases.

You want us to vote a member of\nthe Rules\nCommittee out of the convention every night or something? The secretary\nshould eat\na jellyfish?\n\nMAN\nYou know what sir, don't talk to me like I'm other people. The four of us\nare news\ndirectors and there isn't a day that one of us isn't begging the person we\nwork for to\nlet us for the love of Jesus Christ do the news. Is the Republican nominee\nRob Ritchie?\nYes. Is his running mate Jeff Hesten? Yes. And that question, as impossible\nas it may\nbe to believe becomes even less suspenseful when talking about the Democratic\nticket.\nAnd will there be anything of any force or consequence in the\nplatform? No. Will there\nbe a floor fight over it? What does it matter? And you're getting huffed\nbecause the\nfour of us are questioning the wisdom of presenting a four-day infomercial,\nin primetime,\nunder network news, simulcast? We'll show the acceptance speeches.

Well, it's our first time out, this is exciting. We're not under the\numbrella of\nthe president's protection so there's a couple things I wanna tell you. In\na populated\nplace, a department store, I always walk ahead of you. I don't like more\nthan five feet\nbetween us so if you ditch me cause my back is to you, that would be too\nmuch. Also it\nwould give me no choice but to surround you with department store security\nbefore you\nmade it to Men's Accessories. You're a very recognizable woman, if you're\nsurrounded by\nsecurity, frankly, people are gonna point and stare.\n\nC.J.\nAnything else, Agent Sunshine?\n\nSIMON\nIt's Special Agent Sunshine, but that couldn't matter less. At the risk of\nbeing\nungentlemanly I can't carry bags, my hands always have to be free.\n\nC.J.\nPlus you're not my valet.\n\nSIMON\nYeah but I'm still growing and I got my eyes on the prize.\n\nC.J.\nBernie's on Connecticut at 12:30.\n\nSIMON\nI'm optimistic.

I was telling him that I was taking\nHogan shopping\nfor a Junior Prom dress, a few moments later he referred to the Prom and I\nmade a point\nof correcting him. Why would I do that, I felt so unnatural while I was\nsaying it.\n\nCAROL\nYou were uncomfortable with the image he had in his head of someone who was\nold enough to\nbe the aunt of someone going to the prom and you didn't wanna be charged\nfor the extra year.\n\nC.J.\n[reflects] I'd say that was ridiculous but I also referred to my older\nbrothers.\n\nCAROL\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nYeah but isn't that the kind of thing you do when you meet a guy and\nyou're...\n\nCarol smiles.\n\nC.J.\nNever mind, it was obviously some kind of left-brain hip check, I'll take\ncare of it.\n\nCAROL\nOkay.

They\nidentified\nMohammad Sabeh, a Bahji Cell leader.\n\nPHIL\nLeo, he doesn't have a history of empty rhetoric.\n\nLEO\nWhat would they be striking with?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe calls refer to weaponry that was smuggled in. We don't know what kind,\nor what\nlevel of force.\n\nLEO\nWhy would they pick those two? There are a couple dozen bases on the seaboard\nthat are\nbigger than Dover and Fort Myer, why not in the Carolinas?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThat has us concerned.

You want to back out?\n\nSIMON\nNo, I'm just worried about what I'm going to do with the other two. I'll be\nworking\nagainst muscle memory.\n\nC.J.\nLook, if you want to back out...\n\nSimon begins shooting the gun making C.J. recoil and cover her ears from\nthe loudness\nof the shots. Simon puts down his and presses the button to bring the\nbulls-eye in to\nview. There are three holes right next to each other on the bull's-eye.\n\nC.J.\nWow. That's what I call dead center. What happen to the other two bullets?\n\nSIMON\nWhat do you mean?\n\nC.J.\nThere were five bullets, and I don't believe it.\n\nSIMON\nThree dead center.\n\nC.J.\nHow do you shoot like that?\n\nSIMON\nThey give us lessons.\n\nC.J.\nI don't believe it.\n\nSIMON\nWell?\n\nC.J.\nYes. Yes. I like that you're tall.\n\nSIMON\nYou do?\n\nC.J.\nIt makes me feel more feminine.

No, it takes care... We get the leadership to\nschedule the\nwelfare vote for next week on the day we're supposed to be in New York. We\ncan't go\n'cause we got to work the vote and the early vote gives Amy no time to\nmobilize.\n\nLEO\nDone.\n\nJOSH\nThis is good.\n\nLEO\nToby, an encouraging word from you to Sam wouldn't be totally out of line.\n\nTOBY\nSam doesn't need to be patronized.

It's been this way since the Romans.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nIn peacetime.\n\nLEO\nYes.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe battle of Agincourt this was the French fighting against the British\narchers, this\nwas like a polo match. The battles were observed by heralds and they picked\nthe winners.\nAnd if a soldier laid down his arm he was treated humanely.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nAnd the international laws that you're talking about, this is where a lot\nof them were\nwritten. At a time in a place where a person could tell between peacetime\nand wartime.\nThe idea of targeting one person was ridiculous. It wouldn't have occurred\nto the French\nto try to kill William Pitt.

Why is it for every good thing you do around here,\nwe've got\nto endure three screwiest.\n\nJOSH\nWell, I'm sorry about the...\n\nBARTLET\nSorry doesn't get me 218. It doesn't get back the ad that slipped through\nyour office\nany more then it gets back tobacco which you gave away for lunch money. And\nwhy the hell\ndon't you know what Ritchie's commitments are before you get anywhere near\nmy schedule?\nI've got the Presidential Box at a cattle call. Win the damn vote.\n\nJOSH\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI've got a G-8 briefing.\n\nJOSH\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT\nC.J. and Simon walking to her house.\n\nC.J.\nThat was a fun party. I'd wish you'd come inside.\n\nSIMON\nI'd wish you'd let me use the car.\n\nC.J.\nIt's two blocks.\n\nSIMON\nThat's not the point.\n\nC.J.\nYou're not big on fun, are you?\n\nSIMON\nMe?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSIMON\nI'm nothing but fun. What are you doing wrong right now?\n\nC.J.\nWalking on the wrong side of you.\n\nSIMON\nYes.\n\nC.J.\n[switches sides] We couldn't just be two people who are walking home at the\nend of the night?\n\nSIMON\nWe are.\n\nC.J.\nYou know you told me a few days ago that you were at Rosslyn and I never\nsaid anything.\nI should have said something.\n\nSIMON\nNah.\n\nC.J.\nWhat was your, um, what was your job right then?\n\nSIMON\nTo take the shooters down.\n\nC.J.\nI guess I figured.\n\nSIMON\nI had a pretty good angle on the left. Which was Ray Beckwith.\n\nC.J.\nWhich one was Beckwith? I get them mixed up.\n\nSIMON\nThe 15-year old.\n\nC.J.\nDid you hit him?\n\nSIMON\nA lot of people shooting at him. Yeah I hit him. I know I did. I killed\nhim. See?\nAnd you said I can't be fun.\n\nC.J.\nI just like your smile is all. I wouldn't mind seeing it more.\n\nThey lean in to kiss each other but stop.\n\nSIMON\nI can't.\n\nC.J.\nNo, yeah, no...\n\nSIMON\nYou know I can't.\n\nC.J.\nI was just, you're right, 'cause walking in these heels...\n\nSIMON\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nAren't you supposed to be walking in front of me?\n\nSIMON\nIn a crowded place, but...\n\nC.J.\nWe feel free to take chances.\n\nSIMON\nI'll walk in front.\n\nC.J.\nForget it, I'm home.\n\nSIMON\nLook...\n\nC.J.\nCan we drop it?\n\nSIMON\nSure. I'd just like to say...\n\nC.J.\nI say can we drop it, you say sure and then we don't drop it.\n\nSIMON\nOkay.\n\nPAM THAYER\nThis is Thayer, four past midnight. I've got Flamingo from Donavon.\n\nSIMON\nAll right, take it easy Pam.\n\nPAM\nGoodnight, boss. [to C.J.] Ready?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WLC BUILDING - NIGHT\nJosh is waiting downstairs as Amy and a few colleagues walk down.\n\nJOSH\nIt's got to costing you an awful lot of PAC money.\n\nAMY\nYou didn't want to come up?\n\nJOSH\nIt's after midnight; they wouldn't let me up.\n\nAMY\nWe were working late.\n\nJOSH\nYes, you are. You know for every vote on the left you grab, I got to get\none on the right.\nYou know what that does to the bill?\n\nAMY\nYeah, so we've been phone-banking the Bible Belt telling them how weak the\nabstinence\nprovisions are.\n\nJOSH\nI've seen you level hotel ballrooms screaming about how ridiculous abstinence\nis.\n\nAMY\nI don't want to sleep with these guys, I just want there vote.\n\nJOSH\nAmy, when these things are over and we win, you know who's job it is to pay\na visit to\nthe people who weren't with us?\n\nAMY\nWhat happened?\n\nJOSH\nNothing.\n\nAMY\nYou just threatened me, honey. What happened?\n\nJOSH\nI'm saying that just 'cause you have Sherry Lansing's platinum card doesn't\nmean you\ngo toe-to toe with the people...\n\nAMY\nJosh.\n\nJOSH\n...who are writing the federal budget when they need you.\n\nAMY\nYou going to put the women's movement out of business?\n\nJOSH\nThere's a bigger picture. There's an election in November and you are a\nplayer in a\npolitical party.\n\nAMY\nIf you win by selling out the party who cares who wins? \"Jed Bartlet: Not\nquite as\nmean-spirited as the other guy.\" Doesn't really send me running to my polling\nplace.\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nAMY\nAre you coming over?\n\nJOSH\nI have to go back to the office. [starts to leave]\n\nAMY\n[louder, after him] We ought to be able to talk about this.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nLeo walks in.\n\nLEO\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat are you doing here? It's 1:00 in the morning.\n\nLEO\nI called over to the residence. They said you were in the office.\n\nBARTLET\nYou were home?\n\nLEO\nYeah. By the way, I signed off on canceling the trip. I signed off on setting\ntheir vote.\n\nBARTLET\nYou came over here to stand in front of Josh?\n\nLEO\nNo. It's almost 8:00 AM in Qumar. You shouldn't cancel the trip. You should\ntell me to call\nthe State Department.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat are you...\n\nLEO\nWhat are the alternatives? Are we going to attack Qumar?\n\nBARTLET\nMaybe.\n\nLEO\nNow? We could kill all the armed teenagers we want, we still won't have\nShareef. Let's\nget some more intelligence, let's some more counsel.\n\nBARTLET\nMore counsel is going to help me violate international law.\n\nLEO\nIt's pretty easy to say this is a war scenario.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's pretty easy to say anything is a war scenario.\n\nLEO\nThis is...\n\nBARTLET\nThe war on poverty. It's a slippery slope.\n\nLEO\nStop it.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nLEO\nJust stop it already. This is the most horrifying part of your liberalism. You\nthink\nthere are moral absolutes.\n\nBARTLET\nThere are moral absolutes.\n\nLEO\nApparently not. He's killed innocent people. He'll kill more, so we have to\nend him.\nThe village idiot comes to that conclusion before the Nobel Laureate.\n\nBARTLET\nIl Principe has justified every act of oppression...\n\nLEO\nThis is justified. This is required.\n\nBARTLET\nSays who?\n\nLEO\nSays me, Mr. President. You want to go ask some more people, they'll say so,\ntoo.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, a mob mentality is just...\n\nLEO\nNot a mob. Just you. Right now. This decision. Which by the way is one of\nself-defense.\nLet Shareef come here and we have options. Cancel the trip and we have\nnone. That's all\nwe're talking about right now.\n\nBARTLET\nThere are moral absolutes. Make the call.\n\nLEO\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John\nWells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

{"text": "<pre>THE WEST WING\n\"POSSE COMITATUS\"\nWRITTEN BY: AARON SORKIN\nDIRECTED BY: ALEX GRAVES\n\nTEASER\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY\nThe reporters laugh and chat as C.J. holds a briefing.\n\nC.J.\nWe're leaving exactly one hour later than we planned. At 5:00, he'll board\nMarine One for\nthe trip to Andrews, where he'll board Air Force One for the trip to New\nYork. We're just\ntrying to be helpful because we understand that a Presidential motorcade\nrolling through\nmidtown Manhattan around 6:00, 6:30 really helps keep things well-lubed out\nthere. As a\nmatter of fact, we apologize to New Yorkers for the inconvenience, but the\ndelay was\ninevitable.\n\nThe reporters chuckle.\n\nC.J.\nI meant to say 'unavoidable.' The delay was unavoidable. The President will\nmake a short\nvisit at City Hall and be in his feet at 7:30.\n\nARTHUR\nWhy is this such an early curtain?\n\nC.J.\nThe play is 19 hours long.\n\nThe reporters laugh.\n\nC.J.\nIt's long. It's five and a half hours.\n\nKATIE\nDo you have a nose count yet this morning?\n\nC.J.\nOn the welfare bill?\n\nKATIE\nYeah. I heard there was more movement last night.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, there's movement. It's close.\n\nKATIE\nHow close?\n\nC.J.\nLook at the color of Josh Lyman's hair.\n\nSTEVE\nHow much of at least the summer plan for the campaign depends on winning\nthe vote?\n\nC.J.\nI'd go beyond that. I'd say the future of the entire world depends on it.\n\nMore laughter.\n\nC.J.\nI don't want to scare anybody, but I'd call your Congressman. Mark?\n\nMARK\nSeriously, 50 dollars if you give me a straight answer. Are they gonna meet\ntonight?\n\nC.J.\nThe President and Governor Ritchie?\n\nMARK\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nI don't know.\n\nMARK\nNow, I'm just gonna blow it on booze and women.\n\nMore laughter.\n\nC.J.\nAnything else? I'll see you in New York.\n\nCHRIS\nUh, wait. You never told us why the delay.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry?\n\nCHRIS\nWhy is the President leaving an hour later?\n\nC.J.\nHe scheduled a last-minute meeting.\n\nCHRIS\nWith who?\n\nC.J.\nGood question.\n\nC.J. flips through her copy of the President's schedule, runs her index\nfinger on the\nsecond page until she sees the name.\n\nC.J.\nQumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY\nLeo, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and intelligence personnel are already\nsettled inside,\nwaiting on the President.\n\nLEO\nWhere'd we get the wires crossed? How'd the Pentagon put it on the schedule?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWe didn't get the wires crossed.\n\nLEO\nHe's meeting with the guy. He's gonna be in the Oval Office.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nHe was always gonna do that.\n\nLEO\nIt wasn't cancelled?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nNo way.\n\nLEO\nFitz...\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe White House cancels a meeting at the last minute, he's gonna have somebody\ntasting\nhis food for a month. I don't want him thinking.\n\nLEO\nI don't want the President... All right. I was gonna say I don't want him\nputting a voice\nto the guy. I take my daughter to a seafood place, the first thing she does\nis name all\nthe lobsters in the tank, so I can't eat them.\n\nThe doors fly open for Bartlet, and everyone stands.\n\nOFFICER\nTen-hut.\n\nBARTLET\nHello.\n\nLEO\nGood morning, sir.\n\nEveryone else greets the President before they all sit.\n\nMAN\nMr. President, we wanted to lay out some of the rules.\n\nBARTLET\nThere are rules for these things?\n\nMAN\n[pause] Uh, yes sir. The first one being the National Security Act, which\nsays basically\nthat only the President can trigger a covert action. This isn't a situation\nwhere you\nneed to know as little as possible. The law requires that you know everything.\n\nBARTLET\nDoesn't the law also require that I not assassinate someone?\n\nMAN 2\nYes. Political assassination is banned by Executive Order. Two Executive\nOrders, as a\nmatter of fact.\n\nBARTLET\nI know. One of them was mine.\n\nLEO\nThe E.O. is law, but it was made up by the Executive, and the Executive can\nignore it.\n\nBARTLET\nAssume for a second I say yes. How do we do it? Fitz walks up to him with\na gun?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nNo, it can't be military.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits the military from civilian law\nenforcement, and\nit can't happen on American soil.\n\nBARTLET\nThe things we choose to care about.\n\nMAN 3\nMr. President, I should mention that if you give the order, the law insists\nthat you\ninform what we call the gang of eight. That's the leadership on both parties\nand both\nhouses and the chairpeople and ranking members of the two intelligence\ncommittees.\n\nBARTLET\nIf it can't happen here, then why'd we care that Shareef was delivering\nhimself?\n\nFitzwallace has already walked next to the computer display.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nHe's flying back tonight in his gulfstream. The pilot will be one of our\npeople. They'll\nexperience a mechanical failure about 90 minutes into the flight and set\ndown in a remote\nRAF strip in Bermuda. It's really not much more than a road in the grass.\n\nBARTLET\nThe British say yes?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHow many over there know about this?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThree.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd some people in Bermuda?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYes, sir.\n\nLEO\n[to everyone] This is as big as the club gets, all right?\n\nBARTLET\n[uneasily] Okay. Well... surely, this is the most absurd meeting I ever sat\nin, and\nfriends, that is saying something.\n\nAs Bartlet rises, everyone else does.\n\nMAN 3\nSir, will you be exchanging gifts with Shareef when you meet this afternoon?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I imagine.\n\nMAN 3\nWe'd like you to give him this.\n\nHe nods to the man next to him. The man walks over to Bartlet while pulling\nout a pen\nfrom his jacket pocket. He hands the pen to the President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat does the pen do? Squirts poison?\n\nMAN 3\nIt's got a small recording device in there. He'll probably throw it in the\ntrash, but you\nnever know. You might get lucky. He sticks it in his pocket on the flight\nhome.\n\nFrom him, Bartlet looks down at the pen on his hand. He glances at Leo and\ndrops the pen\non the table. He starts to walk out.\n\nMAN 3\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nWe give him it boxed. Tell them to put it in a box.\n\nBartlet walks out.\n\nCUT TO: INT. TULLY'S BREAKFAST PLACE - DAY\nJosh and Amy are giving their orders to the waitress.\n\nAMY\nCan I get an egg-white omelet and some toast that's badly burnt?\n\nJOSH\nJust coffee, thanks.\n\nWAITRESS\nYes.\n\nThe waitress leaves. Josh turns to Amy.\n\nJOSH\nThat doesn't give you cancer?\n\nAMY\nBurnt toast?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nAMY\nThey're not sure. That's why I have the egg-white omelet.\n\nJOSH\nWelfare is a core issue with swing and independent voters. They use it as\na barometer to\nmeasure a President's values on work and responsibility.\n\nAMY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWe're gonna win the vote.\n\nAMY\nWe'll see.\n\nJOSH\nWe will... but we're gonna. I have a nine-point margin.\n\nAMY\nI think you're gonna lose Burnet, Bristol and Keith.\n\nJOSH\nThey're on that fence?\n\nAMY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nYou understand we have to authorize welfare one way or another. You got to\ndo it every\nsix years.\n\nAMY\nHave I done something to make you think I'm dumb?\n\nJOSH\nAmy...\n\nAMY\nDoesn't the fact that you have to re-authorize it means that Republicans...?\n\nJOSH\nYou have an extra billion in child care.\n\nAMY\nThat's great, but the marriage incentives are terrible.\n\nJOSH\nWe don't like the marriage incentives, either. Don't be ridiculous, but\nindependent\nvoters...\n\nAMY\nPlease say \"white men\" instead of \"independent voters,\" and if you're serious\nabout\nmaking welfare a second chance and not a way of life, then you have to give\npeople job\ntraining.\n\nJOSH\nCall off the hunt, and I'll see to it that you guys can make up with The\nWhite House.\n\nAMY\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\n'Cause we're gonna win.\n\nCUT TO: INT. A QUIET HOME - DAY\nCharlie rings the doorbell. Nobody answers. He peeks in the side window and\nknocks on the\ndoor. A woman opens the door slightly and looks at Charlie.\n\nMS. DEBORAH FIDERER\nYes?\n\nCHARLIE\nMrs. DiLaguardia?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nYes?\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's Charlie. I think there's trouble with your phone line. We kept getting\ndisconnected.\n\nMS.

FIDERER\nI wasn't interested in the job.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy didn't you just say so?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nYou would have asked why.\n\nCHARLIE\nYeah.\n\nMS. FIDERER\nMy way was faster.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy aren't you interested...?\n\nShe slams the door before Charlie could finish. Charlie knocks again. She\nopens the door.\n\nMS. FIDERER\nSo you have my address. What other corners of my personal life have you\nrooted out?\n\nCHARLIE\nYou worked at The White House. We know where you live.\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI bet you do.\n\nCHARLIE\nMay I come inside for one minute?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nYou're not allowed to park there.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, I am.\n\nMS. FIDERER\nAll right.\n\nShe finally lets Charlie inside. They walk to the living room.\n\nCHARLIE\nMrs. DiLaguardia.\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI'm not married to Mr. DiLaguardia anymore. My name is Debbie Fiderer.\n\nCHARLIE\nFidler?\n\nMS.

FIDERER\nNo.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nOh, this is so much worse than the phone call would have been.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nBecause I don't work for anyone, Charlie. I'm my own boss. I set my sail\nand go that\nparticular direction. [points]\n\nCHARLIE\nYou do?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nYes.\n\nCHARLIE\nHow's the sailing been?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI beg your pardon?\n\nCHARLIE\nHow's business?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI'll admit I got off to a rocky start.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat'd you try?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nGambling.\n\nCHARLIE\nDidn't work out?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nNo, but all that's changed.\n\nCHARLIE\n'Cause now you're...?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI'm an alpaca farmer.\n\nCHARLIE\nAre you serious?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nIt's the world's finest livestock investment, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou're talking about those sheep they show on late-night T.V.?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nWell, they're alpacas, and if you knew that, you'd know that the textiles\nmade from their\nfiber are coveted by the best fashion houses.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou swallowed a brochure?\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI have two of the Huacaya variety.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou were Executive to the head of the U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee,\n\nMS. FIDERER\nYes.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm sending a car for you in 90 minutes. [heads for the door]\n\nMS. FIDERER\nI was fired from The White House, Charlie.\n\nCHARLIE\nI know you were.\n\nCharlie opens the door. Ms. Fiderer watches him leave.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

You should bring your mom a souvenir from The\nWhite House.\nEveryday, you should show your mom some expression of love. A smile. \"You\nlook pretty\ntoday, mom.\" A good smack on the ass they always like.\n\nAnthony chuckles.\n\nSIMON\nYou know why you should give your mom an expression of love everyday?\n\nANTHONY\n'Cause she raised me?\n\nSIMON\nWell, okay. I was gonna say just to make things easier.\n\nSimon pushes the doors to JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA, where he starts getting coffee.\n\nANTHONY\nSo, you're gonna be careful in New York, right?\n\nSIMON\nWe're only going for a few hours.\n\nANTHONY\nNo, I mean when the crazy guy shows up.\n\nSIMON\nYou don't think I can handle myself?\n\nANTHONY\nWell...\n\nSIMON\nWhat?\n\nANTHONY\nYou got skills. I don't deny that. You can shoot, and you're athletic.\n\nSIMON\nBut?\n\nANTHONY\nYou're slow-witted.\n\nSIMON\nLet the beatings begin.\n\nANTHONY\n[laughs] You're not very bright, and the criminals can sense this about you.\n\nSimon taps Anthony's face a couple of times and grabs his head for a headlock.\n\nSIMON\nCome here.\n\nC.J.\nGood morning.\n\nC.J. is standing in the middle of the hallway, watching them. Simon lets\nAnthony go and\nalmost dutifully stands to the side.\n\nSIMON\nGood morning.\n\nC.J.\nI thought you weren't on 'til this afternoon.\n\nSIMON\nI'm not. I arranged this for my friend Anthony here. Anthony, this is\nMs. Cregg.\n\nANTHONY\nHi.\n\nC.J.\nHey.

[walks off]\n\nC.J.\nIt'll have the Seal of the President on it, and President Bartlet's signature,\nand you\ncan tell your mom that you can't buy this in a souvenir shop. In fact,\nyou can't buy it\nanywhere 'cause it's against the law to sell the Seal of the President. You\ncan only get\nit here.\n\nANTHONY\nYeah, but if the cops stopped me, aren't they gonna think I stole it?\n\nC.J.\nIf the cops stopped you, they're gonna think you're an important person.\n\nSIMON\nStop you for what?\n\nANTHONY\nWhatever.\n\nSIMON\nWait outside a second, will you?\n\nANTHONY\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nNice meeting you.\n\nAnthony heads to the lobby.

There's also singing.\n\nSTANLEY\nOh, it's a musical?\n\nBARTLET\nNo, but they're gonna sing from time to time, and one of the songs is a song\nI love.\nI can't think of the name now, but it's an Edwardian... It always reminds\nme... It makes\nme think of college, like, I don't know, like they should be singing it in\nthe dining\nhall at Christ College at Cambridge. The chorus is, \"And victorious in war\nshall be made\nglorious in peace.\" I was just singing it this morning.\n\nA moment of silence.\n\nSTANLEY\nHow have you been sleeping?\n\nBARTLET\nGood. Yeah. Let me ask you something. Is there a crime, which if it wasn't\nillegal, you\nwould do?\n\nSTANLEY\nI'd park anywhere I want.\n\nBARTLET\nRight, but you wouldn't rob a bank?\n\nSTANLEY\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nConnecticut had a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. It was written\nout of rage\nagainst adultery. But in the age of AIDS, don't Connecticut residents do\nmore for the\ngeneral welfare by flagrantly breaking the law?\n\nSTANLEY\nThere was a law against... contraceptives?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nSTANLEY\nCan I ask, sir, how somebody used to get caught?\n\nBARTLET\nStanley...\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat's on your mind, Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nI can't tell you.\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah, but you can.\n\nBartlet pauses, looks away and thinks.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, I really can't.

[to\nthe grocer] Sir,\nI hate to be a problem customer, but if I don't get a Milky Way bar pretty\nsoon...\n\nHe is interrupted by movement and did not have time to react. Simon is\nimmediately thrown\nbackward by three deafening shots. A second robber has been hiding in the\nback aisle. The\nlong-haired goon runs outside after shooting Simon. The grocer panics. He\nlooks at Simon's\nbody and runs out as well. In the background, a melancholy tune starts to\nplay.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT\nThe play continues. Bartlet watches from his balcony.\n\nWOMAN\nToo... too unpardonable. Off with the crown, and with the crown, his head. And\nwhilst we\nbreathe, take time to do him dead.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThat is my office for my father's sake.\n\nWOMAN\nNay. Stay. Let's hear the orisons he makes.\n\nOLDER MAN\nShe-wolf of France! But worse than wolves of France, whose tongue more\npoisons...\n\nBartlet stands and leaves. In the other balcony, Ron gets C.J.'s\nattention. They walk out.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THEATER ENTRANCE - NIGHT\nRon delivers the horrible news. C.J. listens attentively. Outside, a barrage\nof lights shine.\nThe song \"Hallelujah\" continues.\n\n\tI heard there was a secret chord\n\tThat David played and it pleased the Lord\n\tBut you don't really care for music, do you?\n\nC.J.\nSomebody's made a mistake. He was just on his way to the field office...\n\nRON\nNo.\n\nC.J. tries hard to accept the news, putting her hand on her forehead. The\nsong drains out\ntheir conversation.\n\n\tIt goes like this, the fourth, the fifth\n\tThe minor fall, the major lift\n\tThe baffled king composing hallelujahs.\n\tHallelujah...\n\nC.J.\nExcuse me.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT\nThe police have arrived, taking pictures of Simon's body. He is still down\non the ground,\nbeside the many flowers.\n\n\tHallelujah...\n\nCUT TO: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT\nC.J. is teary-eyed. She walks amongst the people, the lights, the\nconfusion. She bumps into\nsomeone, who just walks on.\n\n\tWell, your faith was strong, but you needed proof\n\tYou saw her bathing on the roof\n\tHer beauty in the moonlight overthrew you\n\tShe tied you to a kitchen chair\n\tShe broke your throne, she cut your hair\n\tAnd from your lips, she drew the hallelujah.\n\tHallelujah, Hallelujah...\n\nC.J. finds a bench to sit on. She gazes up and ahead, still crying.\n\nCUT TO: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT\nRon sees the fallen agent, and kneels down beside him.\n\n\tHallelujah, Hallelujah...\n\nCUT TO: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nJosh and Amy walk to the kitchen. The same song is faintly heard in the\nbackground.\n\nJOSH\nWhat'd you think I was gonna do?\n\nAMY\nI thought you were gonna do this.\n\nJOSH\nAnd?\n\nAMY\nAnd I didn't think it was gonna work.\n\nJOSH\nAre you fired?\n\nAMY\nI'm resigning on Monday.\n\nJOSH\nDo you have to?\n\nAMY\nI had an entire policy initiative reversed in an hour. Weren't you given\nthe chance to get\nthe votes you needed by setting up a meeting with Ritchie?\n\nJOSH\nI'm not a dating service.\n\nAMY\n[slams the fridge] What is wrong with you?!\n\nJOSH\nEvery serious Democrat is gonna unite behind this President, and I'm not\nkidding around.\n\nAMY\nEvery serious Democrat should be thinking about leading and not following.\n\nJOSH\nYeah? How's it going so far?\n\nAMY\nMatter of fact, it's going all right, and I'd do it again.\n\nJOSH\nThat's what's scaring the hell out of me.\n\nAMY\nGood. It's about time.\n\nThe phone in the living room rings.\n\nJOSH\nYou can't win the White House while the middle class thinks you disdain work\nand responsibility.\n\nAMY\nI would hope not, and I congratulate you for punishing poor women as the\nsymbol of the\nstrength of mainstream values.\n\nJOSH\nThat's not what we did.\n\nAmy walks to the phone and picks it up.\n\nAMY\nHello?\n\nJOSH\nDo you not consider it relevant that it would be worse with Rob Ritchie in\nthe White House?\nWhy is that not part of the equation?\n\nAMY\nHoney, Simon Donovan was shot and killed.\n\nJosh stops and reaches to answer the phone.\n\n\tAnd the holy dove was moving too\n\tAnd every breath we drew was hallelujah.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THEATER HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n\tHallelujah...\n\nIt's the play's first intermission. Leo walks along the dark terrace\nhallway. He sees Bartlet\nby the corner, peering downstairs. They meet and talk quietly.\n\nBARTLET\nCivilians get trials.\n\nLEO\nI'd argue he's not a civilian. So would the Attorney General.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're gonna find out it's us. We could make it look like the plane went\ndown, but they're\ngonna find out it's us, and I'm gonna be running for reelection while I'm\nfighting a war\nagainst Qumar.\n\nLEO\nThat's why you want to say no?\n\nBARTLET\nI want him tried.\n\nLEO\nThat can't happen.\n\nBARTLET\nI understand.\n\nLEO\nI was talking this morning about how Mallory names all the lobsters in the\ntank.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nWould it be helpful if I brought you a list of names of Shareef's victims?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nLEO\nWho was the monk who wrote, \"I always don't know the right thing to do,\nLord, but I think\nthe fact that I want to please you pleases you.\" [beat] You have two minutes,\nsir.\n\nBARTLET\nThis isn't a matter of religion.\n\nLEO\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI recognize that there's evil in the world.\n\nLEO\nWhat is your objection exactly, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nDoesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?\n\nLEO\nThat's your objection? I'm not gonna have trouble saying the Pledge of\nAllegiance tomorrow.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's not my objection.\n\nLEO\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nIt's just wrong. It's absolutely wrong.\n\nLEO\nI know, but you have to do it anyway.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\n'Cause you won.\n\nBartlet pauses. He starts to walk away, but he stops right in front of Leo's\nshoulder.\n\nBARTLET\nTake him.\n\nHe continues on his way. Silent. Leo grabs his phone and dials.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THEATER MESS - NIGHT\nBartlet walks down a flight of stairs, past the men's bathroom. A shadow of\na man is cast\non the bathroom door, while the man washes his hands. Bartlet lights his\ncigarette in the\nmess. A female employee spots him.\n\nBARTLET\n[smiling] Caught me.\n\nBehind Bartlet, Governor ROBERT RITCHIE exits the bathroom. Ritchie sees\nthe President and\napproaches.\n\nROBERT RITCHIE\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nGovernor.\n\nRITCHIE\nYou enjoying the play?\n\nBARTLET\nI am. How about you?\n\nRITCHIE\nWe just got here. We were at the Yankee game. We were, you know, hung up in\ntraffic.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I know. Listen, politics aside, and I don't want to make a big deal\nout of it, but\nyou probably insulted the church, and you can head it off at the pass if\nyou speak to the\nCardinal tonight.\n\nRITCHIE\nWell, I didn't mean to insult anybody.\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nRITCHIE\nAnd it's a baseball game. It's how ordinary Americans...\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. [beat] No, I don't understand that. The center fielder for the Yankees\nis an accomplished\nclassical guitarist. People who like baseball can't like books?\n\nRITCHIE\nAre you taking this personally?\n\nBARTLET\nNo. Something horrible happened about an hour ago.\n\nThe two find a place to sit across each other.\n\nBARTLET\nC.J. Cregg was getting threats so we put an agent on her. He's a good guy. He\nwas on my\ndetail for a while, and he was in Rosslyn. He walked in the middle of an\narmed robbery,\nand was shot and killed after detaining one of the suspects.\n\nRITCHIE\nOh. Crime. Boy, I don't know.\n\nBARTLET\n[sighs] We should have a great debate, Rob. We owe it to everyone. When I\nwas running as a\ngovernor, I didn't know anything. I made them start Bartlet college in my\ndining room.\nTwo hours every morning on foreign affairs and the military. You can do that.\n\nRITCHIE\nHow many different ways you think you're gonna find to call me dumb?\n\nBARTLET\nI wasn't, Rob. But you've turned being un-engaged into a Zen-like thing,\nand you shouldn't\nenjoy it so much is all, and if it appears at times as if I don't like you,\nthat's the\nreason why.\n\nRITCHIE\nYou're what my friends call a superior sumbitch. You're an academic elitist\nand a snob.\nYou're, uh, Hollywood, you're weak, you're liberal, and you can't be\ntrusted. And if it\nappears from time to time as if I don't like you, well, those are just a\nfew of the many\nreasons why.\n\nThe start of a great tune is played inside the theater.\n\nBARTLET\nThey're playing my song.\n\nBartlet stands and heads to the stairs, but he turns to Ritchie before\nreaching them.\n\nBARTLET\nIn the future, if you're wondering, \"Crime. Boy, I don't know\" is when I\ndecided to kick\nyour ass.\n\nRitchie can't help but smile as Bartlet heads upstairs.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT\nA bright, young boy runs center stage. He starts to sing.\n\n\tEngland arise. Join in the chorus.\n\tThis is a new made song,\n\tYou should be... singing.\n\tSee in the skies, fluttering before us,\n\tWhat the bright bird of peace is bringing\n\tAh...\n\nOther actors walk on stage, joining the boy in the chorus.\n\n\tSee upon a smiling land\n\tWhere the wealth of nations stand.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. REMOTE LANDING STRIP IN BERMUDA - NIGHT\nA man distributes loaded rifles to each sniper. The chorus song is still\nheard aloud.\n\n\tWhere prosperity and industry\n\tWalk ever hand in hand.\n\tWhere so many blessings crowd\n\t'Tis our duty to be proud.\n\tUp and answer English yeoman\n\nCUT TO: INT. SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT\nFitzwallace is alone in the room, waiting by the phone. The song continues.\n\n\tSing it joyfully aloud!\n\nBack in the LANDING STRIP, a private plane lands. A sniper watches via night\nvision.\n\n\tEvery garner filled with grain\n\tEvery meadow blessed with rain.\n\nAbdul Shareef and his two bodyguards exit the plane. They look around\nunknowingly. The\nsnipers take aim and fire, sending Shareef and the bodyguards down on the\nground. Dead.\n\n\tRich and fertile is the golden corn\n\tThat bears and bears again.\n\nBartlet stares at the stage THEATER. In the LANDING STRIP, one of the snipers\ntakes the pen\nrecorder from Shareef and attaches it to a compatible phone. Fitzwallace\npicks up the phone\nin the SITUATION ROOM.\n\n\tWhere so many blessings crowd\n\t'Tis our duty to be proud.\n\nIn the theater HALLWAY, Leo answers his phone. Bartlet turns his head to look.\n\n\tUp and answer English yeoman\n\tSing it joyfully aloud!\n\nThe actors in the stage are now waving several flags. From behind them,\nthe lights get\nblocked from time to time. In the hallway, Leo hangs up. Bartlet stands.\n\n\tUpon our country\n\tGod will pour his rich increase,\n\nBartlet and Leo meet. Bled out by the loud singing, Leo relays the news\nbefore walking away.\n\n\tAnd victorious in war\n\tShall be made glorious in peace.\n\tGlorious in peace.\n\tGlorious in peace.\n\tGlorious in peace.\n\tGlorious...\n\nBartlet steps behind a curtain, casting a silhouette. For a while, Bartlet's\nshadow just\nstands out, and it is the only thing we see.\n\n\t...in peace!\n\tIn peace!

[Crowd cheers and applauds.] You\nknow the story\nabout the guy whose cars gets stuck in a muddy hole. A farmer comes along\nand says he'll\npull the car out of the mud but he's going to have to charge 50 bucks 'cause\nthis is the\ntenth time he's had to pull it out of the mud today. The driver says, \"God,\nwhen to you\nhave time to plow your land, at night?\" The farmer says, \"No, no. Nighttimeis\nwhen I fill\nthe whole with water.\" [Crowd laughs.] We need to find energy\nalternatives. We're getting\nour cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying\nto convince\nus that they care about new energy and that they're not in the vest pockets\nof big oil,\nand that's a tough sell. I don't envy them, 'cause their only hope is that\nwe don't notice\nthat they're the ones who are filling the hole with water every night,\nand I think Americans\nare smarter then that. I think we noticed.\n\nWhile the crowd cheers and applauds, C.J. walks across the stage to Donna\nwho is standing\noff to the side.\n\nC.J.\nWhere are Josh and Toby?\n\nDONNA\nThey're in the soybean fields, talking to Cathy.\n\nC.J.\nCathy...?\n\nDONNA\nThe daughter, but I like saying Toby and Josh are in the soybean fields.\n\nC.J.\nHe's wrapping up, and we're getting right in the car.

AIR FORCE ONE, PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nBARTLET\nThere's a tremendous amount of informatin you need to keep track of: dates,\nnames, number,\nthings I'm not good with.\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nThat's unusual, isn't it?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's that?\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nA man of your intellect not being good with names and numbers. Especially\nan economist of\nyour stature.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not intellect, it's memory. It's a different gift. A wonderful one. I've\nnever had it.\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nThere are excersises you can do.\n\nBARTLET\nWell... okay, I'll try and find that time, but let's get back to you. What\nwould you say was\nthe most challenging part of working for the Ambassador of France?\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nThe pliable relationship the French have with time.\n\nBARTLET\nMm.\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI make fun of the French as much as anybody and I don't even know what\nthat meant.\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nI meant...\n\nBARTLET\nNah, that's okay. I think you're terrific and I appreciate your coming in\nand talking to us.\n\nMRS. HARRISON\nThank you, sir. I look forward to talking to your office.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks again.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'll be right with you. Can you see Bruno?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Hey.\n\nBRUNO\nYou want some good news, Mr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nPlease, the market's down 425 points.\n\nBRUNO\nWell, I think it's going to rally but even if it doesn't, this one isn't\nattributable to anything...\n\nBARTLET\nI know.\n\nBRUNO\nI'm saying...\n\nBARTLET\n425 points represents billions of dollars which aren't there anymore heading\ninto the fourth\nquarter which is Christmas.\n\nBRUNO\nWell, I thinks it's going to rally.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's your good news?\n\nBRUNO\nWe've held or made slight gains in almost all the polls. ABC/Washington Post,\nBartlet 50, Ritchie 44.\nI'm all right referring to you colloquially? CBS/ New York Times, Bartlet 50,\nRitchie 43. NBC/ Wall\nStreet Journal, Bartlet 49, Ritchie 43.\n\nBARTLET\nYou said almost all.\n\nBRUNO\nCNN/USA Today/ Gallup, Bartlet 46, Ritchie 45.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy does Gallup have it a one-point race?\n\nBRUNO\nIt's 'cause...\n\nBARLTET\n'Cause they're polling likely voters and not registered voters. That's why\nthey're getting the\nsame numbers we do.\n\nBRUNO\nWait till the debates. Elections in six weeks, Mr. President. The world was\ncreated in a lot less time.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, one day I'll buy you a beer and you'll tell us all how you did it.\n\nBRUNO\nThank you, sir.\n\nC.J.\nBruno.\n\nBRUNO\nYeah.\n\nC.J.\nYesterday, the First Lady appeared on KCAL, which is a local LA station. She\nwas asked about\nthe suspension of her medical license and she said something like, \"I'm just\na wife and mother.\"\n\nBRUNO\nAnd that has been interpreted in some circles as merely a wife and mother?\n\nC.J.\nThis is Flint Aldridge, a Southern Baptist radio host. \"This is another sign\nthat Abbey Bartlet\nis a liberal elitist feminist.\"\n\nBRUNO\nElitist, feminist-- you can't do that to the English language.\n\nC.J.\nAnd this is from Janet Ritchie.\n\nBRUNO\nJanet Ritchie went on the record?\n\nC.J.\n\"Being a wife and a mother are the most rewarding roles I've ever played. I\nthink Abbey Bartlet\nand I have two different ambitions.\"\n\nBRUNO\nOoh, she won $50. Said the secret word right there-- ambition. Phyllis\nSchlafly and Ann Coulter\nare going to have a sqaure dance.\n\nC.J.\nAnyway, it's waiting for us down on the ground.\n\nBRUNO\nThen let's stay up here and have drinks.\n\nCAPTAIN\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentleman.\n\nBRUNO\nJanet Ritchie really went on the record?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nBRUNO\nI love it when the women get involved.\n\nCAPTAIN\nI've begun our decent into Andrew's Air Force Base and I'm going to ask\nthose who are so\ninclined to take their seats and fasten their seatbelts.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\n\tA 3:30 - PRESIDENT MET WITH SECRETARY BRYCE,\n\t\t JOINED BY NESSRS.

Do we have some sort of condensed Readers Digest index of... well,\nall human knowledge?\n\nGINGER\nWe usually just use Margaret.\n\nSAM\nOkay, well, we'll have to talk about that but we'll do it another time. Soon,\nthough.

I'm talking about the women,\nthe voters continuing\ntheir unbroken streak. The biggest nonsense issue in the campaign will belong\nto the women. Does\nAbbey Bartlet love her children? Next week, Grandpa: friend or foe?\n\nC.J.\nThis is not a woman's issue. This is dumb woman's issue.\n\nBRUNO\nI think anybody who's got a five-point majority and still doesn't control\nthe agenda, might be\nspending a little to much time reading about how to get a man to get over\nhis fear of commitment.\n\nC.J.\nRemind me to mention that to the population of South Africa.\n\nBRUNO\nYou know what? In the scheme of things?

She said, \"Right now, I'm just a wife\nand mother.\"\n\nLARRY\nOption one is we make a joke out of it.\n\nBRUNO\nWe make a joke out of it? What would we have to do to it to make...?\n\nC.J.\nYeah, the rolling pins took care of that.\n\nBRUNO\nIt is pret-a-porter.\n\nC.J.\nRemind me to get Josh in on this. Option two?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY\nWe pan from a man putting a horse in the back of a trailer to the highway,\nwhere we see\nToby, Donna, Josh and Tyler cruising in the red jeep. They pull off of the\nroad into the\nparking lot of a small diner.\n\nJOSH\nIt's Monday.\n\nDONNA\nYeah. Why?\n\nJOSH\nNothing. It was just something I said. All right, ten minutes. We get the\nstuff to go.\n\nThey walk inside the DINER.\n\nTOBY\nTyler?\n\nTYLER\nYes, sir?\n\nTOBY\nWhat's a Hoosier?\n\nTYLER\nA Hoosier's someone from Indiana.\n\nTOBY\nAfternoon.\n\nFIONA\nYes.\n\nTOBY\nWe'd like some food to go.\n\nFIONA\nWhat would you like?\n\nTOBY\nWhat's good?\n\nFIONA\nEverything.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's your specialty?\n\nFIONA\nTaking someone's order and giving it to them.\n\nTOBY\nOkay.\n\nFIONA\nI saw you drive up. You people going to cause trouble.\n\nTOBY\nI swear not on purpose.\n\nFIONA\nEverytime he comes around here, there's trouble. I don't want leaflets around\nmy place.\nYou handing out leaflets?\n\nTOBY\nNo, uh, we just want food.\n\nFIONA\nYeah, well, what to do need?\n\nTOBY\nYou wouldn't say there was some sort of local delicacy...\n\nFIONA\nI'm getting my husband.\n\nFiona walks off to the back of the diner.\n\nTOBY\nRight, uh... [to man sitting at counter] Excuse me. Would you mind terribly\nif I changed\nthe channel to CNN for just a minute? I've, uh, been a little out of touch\ntoday. I would\nlike to check in with what's been going on.\n\nMAN\nEarl and Fiona don't get cable TV. Three channels are enough. The picture's\nfuzzy today.\nI think there's going to be weather.\n\nFiona and her husband Earl come from the back.\n\nEARL\nWhat the hell, boy?\n\nTOBY\nI was just asking what's good.\n\nEARL\nYeah?\n\nTOBY\nWe'll take four cheeseburgers.\n\nEARL\nThe dry rub is good.\n\nTOBY\nDry rub?\n\nEARL\nYeah. You dry rub the beef with spices for a day or two. Sauce is a myth.\n\nTOBY\nOkay. See, Fiona, this is exactly what I was talking about.\n\nFIONA\nShut up!\n\nFiona trumps off to the back.\n\nEARL\nShe's been in a bad mood for... well, about 45 years, I guess.\n\nCUT TO: INT. DINER TABLE - CONTINUOUS\nDonna, Josh, and Tyler are sitting down at a table in the diner.\n\nDONNA\nOut in the parking lot when you said it's Monday, I flashed on the song. A\nfew days ago,\nsomeone told me that a girl shot up her school one morning and we they asked\nher why,\nshe said, \"I don't like Mondays,\" and that's where the song comes from.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nYou knew that?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nThat's where the song comes from?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nDONNA\nI'm sorry about the time zones.\n\nToby approaches table and sits down.\n\nJOSH\nWhy is it we cite Ritchie's advisors by name? The Milton Friedman economic\nplan? The Leonard\nTynan education plan?\n\nTOBY\nI give credit where credit's due.\n\nJOSH\nIt's our way of calling him a puppet, right?\n\nTOBY\nJosh, he cites them more then we do, which is his way of saying, \"I want to\nbe President\nthe same way you want a cold beer.\"\n\nJOSH\nNo. It's his way of saying, \"I think it's great that Bartlet's a Nobel\nPrize winner.\nWhen I'm elected, I'm going to hire me some of those.\"\n\nTOBY\nNo, no. Should be what he's saying. What he's saying is, \"Eastern education\nisn't for real men,\nbut don't worry. I'll have Jews for the money stuff.\" You mind calling\nC.J. for me?\n\nJOSH\nThat line from the convention speech-- \"challenges too great for a Potemkin\npresidentcy?\"\n\nTOBY\nIt is true.\n\nJOSH\nMost people weren't the smartest kid in the class. Most people didn't like\nthe smartest kid\nin the class.\n\nTOBY\nYeah?\n\nJOSH\nI don't care how subliminal it is. This can't be a national therapy session.\n\nDONNA\nC.J.\n\nDonna hands Toby the cellphone.\n\nTOBY\nThank you. Hello.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nC.J.\n[into phone] Hey, before I forget.

Did you happen to notice that we weren't on the plane?\n\nC.J.\nYou weren't on the plane?\n\nJOSH\nWe missed the plane.\n\nC.J.\nWhat happened between Unionville and the plane?\n\nJOSH\nWe missed Unionville. We missed the motorcade.\n\nC.J.\nBummer.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nFIONA\nDry rub's up!\n\nC.J.\nI love dry rub. They take the meat and...\n\nJosh closes the phone in the middle of C.J.'s sentence.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nSam is waiting in the Oval Office when Bartlet enters from the colonnade.\n\nSAM\nGood afternoon, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nSeth Weinberger's assistant has come forward with the information that he\nwas having an\naffair with a colleague and a newspaper has printed it.\n\nSAM\nWhat's the assistant's thing?\n\nBARTLET\nYou tell me. He'd already stepped down over OSHA. It's been two months. This\nis an assistant\ngetting her name in the paper and it's unbelievably hurtful to his wife. I\ndon't understand it.\nI don't understand the paper printed it either, but that's another day. This\nis terrible.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nCHARLIE\nSecretary Bryce.\n\nBARTLET\nGood.\n\nSAM\nIs there a place you'd like me to stand or sit?\n\nBARTLET\nHmm?\n\nSECRETARY BRYCE\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nMitch, come on in. [to Sam] Just rock and roll, Sam.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nLARRY\n[to Sam] Josh likes to stand over there.\n\nBRYCE\nI wanted to mention first of all, Mr. President, that I think you could seed\nCommerce's input on,\nuh... I'm not going to say what you could seek.\n\nSAM\nActually, Mr. Secretary, if you're talking about he stump speech, and energy\nin particular,\nthat's not the President's fault. I was just looking at my notes from...\n\nBARTLET\nWe have your input. You're talking about the exemption.\n\nBRYCE\nIt is sheer lunacy to suggest America takes unilateral steps while exempting\n80% of the world's\nnations from the same obligations.\n\nBARTLET\nDeveloping nations, and I think what's lunacy is a nation of SUV's telling\na nation of\nbicycles, that they have to change the way the live before we'll agree to\ndo something\nabout greenhouse emission.\n\nBRYCE\nAmong our economic competitors there's the principle of fairness.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, in international law there's a principle called differentiated\nresponsibilties.\nWe're the ones making the greenhouse gas!\n\nThere is a scattered applause. Ed looks at his watch.\n\nED\n47 seconds.\n\nLARRY\nWho had 47 seconds?\n\nBRYCE\nYou're losing the support of the business community.\n\nBARTLET\nMr. Secretary, it's not your job to tell me whose support I'm losing. We\nhave people who\ndo that. It's your job to tell me whose support you just got for me.\n\nBRYCE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nBRYCE\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nSecretary Bryce and his staff depart from the Oval Office, while Bartlet\nwalks to his desk.\n\nBARTLET\n[to Larry] Ed.\n\nLARRY\nWell, I'm Larry, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhatever. Seth Weinberger's old assistant...\n\nLARRY\nI saw that.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't think a lot of blind loyalty, but I think a lot less of blind betrayal.\n\nLARRY\nThat's why I haven't gotten married yet, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, that's probably why.\n\nCHARLIE\nCongressman Lien.\n\nBARTLET\nCould somebody get Leo for me, please? Peter, you hear that? He called you\n\"congressman.\"\n\nCONGRESSMAN PETER LIEN\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou think when your folks got you out in '74, they imagined they were taking\nyou to a place\nthat'd be willing to make you a Congressman?\n\nLIEN\nAs a matter of fact, sir, I think that's exactly what they imagined.\n\nBARTLET\nMe too. How's fishing?\n\nLIEN\nIt's been a good season.\n\nBARTLET\nYou catch any marlin?\n\nLIEN\nMarlin's a game fish, sir. Not a lot of people eat them.\n\nBARTLET\nTakes a fisherman to catch one, though, right?\n\nLIEN\nOh, yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, I'm just saying.\n\nLEO\nGood afternoon, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nLeo, meet Congressman Peter Lien, Texas 22nd. Peter, this is Leo McGarry,\nU.S. Air Force,\n144th Fighter Wing.\n\nLEO\nPleased to meet you, Congressman.\n\nBARTLET\nPeter's family fishes in Galveston Bay, but they don't catch marlin. It's\na sore spot,\nand he doesn't like to talk about it. Peter's 34 years old.\n\nLEO\nI'm sorry it's been two months and we haven't been able to get you up here\nuntil now.\n\nLIEN\nNo, please. It's a bust time. If there's any help I can give you in Texas...\n\nBARTLET\nOrdinarily I would tell you that Jim Coor was a good public servant, and\nyou've got big shoes\nto fill, and he was and you do, but obviously you have a bigger symbolic\nresponsibilty then that.\n\nLIEN\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nBut you biggest responsibiltity isn't symbolic, right?\n\nLIEN\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat is it?\n\nLIEN\nIt's my district, my country, and the Congress of the United States.\n\nBARTLET\nWelcome, my freind, to the show that never ends.\n\nLIEN\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThey turn around to take picture of Congressman Lien shaking Bartlet's\nhands. Sam, Larry, Leo,\nand Bartlet watch the Congressman exit.\n\nBARTLET\nIsn't that a hell of a thing?

I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now but I want\nto get Anthony a\nBig Brother and Charlie said no, and I thought if it was anything you might\nbe interested in,\nI could talk to you about it.

More than any time in\nrecent history, America's\ndestiny is not of our own choosing. We did not seek nor did we provoke an\nassault on our freedom\nand our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation\nwith evil. Yet the true\nmeasure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when\nit does arive. 44 people\nwere killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State University. Three swimmers\nfrom the men's team\nwere killed and two others are in critical condition. When, after having\nheard the explosion from\ntheir practice facility, they ran into the fire to help get people out. Ran\ninto the fire. The\nstreets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students\nand our teachers and\nour parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with\nangels, but every time we\nthink we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and\nwe're reminded that that\ncapacity may well be limitless. this is a time for American heroes.

This thing came up at the last\nminute. A bomb at a\nswimming meet. You probably... I can take you home now. You probably saw it\nhere on the television\nsets.\n\nHe ignores her or turns away.\n\nC.J.\nYou know... I really miss Simon, too. That's... probably something we can\ntalk about. I asked around\ntoday. I wasn't able to find anyone, but I'm not done. There are more people\nI'm asking tomorrow\nI'll take you home now.\n\nAnthony mumbles something.\n\nC.J.\nI'm sorry?\n\nANTHONY\nI said I don't need a baby-sitter, bitch.

She's the White House Press Secretary and senior counsel\nto the President.\nAnd if she wasn't, she would still be Ms. Cregg! I don't mind you not\nrespecting people. I mind\nyou doing it out loud. I mind you doing it in this building. You wanna be\na punk, fine, but I\ndon't think you've got the size for it. You wanna go to juvey, get out,\ndeal, and kill cops?\nOkay, but every time you do a crime, you get caught, so I think you're gonna\nhave to do something\nelse. 9:00 on Saturday mornings, I eat breakfast at Cosmo's on Delaware. I\ncome here for an hour\nand do office work, and then I go to St. Jude's for an hour to play\nbasketball. You can go to juvey,\nor you can be at Cosmo's 9:00 on Saturday morning.

HALLWAY - NIGHT\nIt's late at night and matinence crew is cleaning up. Sam walks out of the\nPresident's outer office\ninto the hallway. He unloosens his tie, and enters his OFFICE where he places\njacket on a chair.\nMallory walks up behind him.\n\nMALLORY\nSchmutsy pants.\n\nSAM\nI know that voice. (turns around)\n\nMALLORY\nI was at the dinner.\n\nSAM\nI didn't see you.\n\nMALLORY\nNice job on the speech.\n\nSAM\nWhat makes you think I wrote it?\n\nMALLORY\n\"We did not seek nor did we provoke...\" \"We did not expect nor did we\ninvite...\"\n\nSAM\nA little thing called cadence.\n\nMALLORY\nIt works for you.\n\nSAM\nHow's New York?\n\nMALLORY\nRichard got traded to the Blackhawks.\n\nSAM\nFor a Zanboni battery?\n\nMALLORY\nAnd Garnier and a first round draft pick.\n\nSAM\nSo you're moving to Chicago.\n\nMALLORY\nRichard and I split.\n\nSAM\n[failing to conceal a grin] That is terrible. That is... the worst thing. I\nam so sorry. I liked him,\ntoo-- his broding stare in the penalty box. If there is anything I can do.\n\nMALLORY\nShut up.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nMALLORY\nI came by to say hi. I came by to tell you I liked the speech.\n\nSAM\nThank you very much.\n\nMALLORY\nMy dad said you staffed the President today.\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nMALLORY\nHow was it?\n\nSAM\nYou know anything about choas theory?\n\nMALLORY\nI know it has to do with fractal geometry.\n\nSAM\nThat's about all I know too. But it has to do with there being order and\neven... great beauty, in\nwhat looks like total choas. And if we look closely enough at the randomness\naround us, patterns\nwill start to emerge. I love Josh like a brother and he's a world-class\npolitical mind but until\ntoday, I didn't know he was smarter then I was. I've worked here three years\nand eight months and\nuntil you sit in the room all day, you can't comprehend the chaos of the\nOval Office. I had one\ngood moment talking about the global ripple effect of budget defict, but\nthat was it. The rest of\nthe day was just keeping up. And this was a pretty light day.\n\nMALLORY\nOne good moment is good.\n\nSAM\nOh, I'm not complaining. I'm saying one good moment is great. It's a golf\nshot. I've got to get back\nin there. That's where it's happening. (beat) You came by just to tell me\nyou liked the speech?\n\nMALLORY\n\"This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars.\"? I'm weak.\n\nSAM\nYeah. I think I stole that from Camelot.\n\nMALLORY\nLet me get you home. I don't think you're going to make it.\n\nSAM\nYeah. I don't think I'm going to make it, either.\n\nThey walk out to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE and continue to the HALLWAY.\n\nMALLORY\nCamelot?\n\nSAM\nGood writers borrow from other writers. Great writers steal from them outright.\n\nMALLORY\nGood night, Charlie.\n\nSAM\nGood night, Charlie.\n\nSam and Mallory walk out of the building while we follow Charlie into the\nOUTER OVAL OFFICE. There's\na white box wrapped with purple ribbon on Charlie's desk. Charlie notices\nthe box and looks around to\nsee if the person who put it there is in the room. Ho opens the box and\nstares at the object inside.\nC.J. enters the room.\n\nC.J.\nThe picture's from Deanna. I just put it in a frame. I've had it in my office\nfor about a week.\nI just keep forgetting to give it to you.\n\nCHARLIE\nThanks. It's nice.\n\nC.J.\nHave a good night.\n\nCHARLIE\nGood night.\n\nC.J. leaves. Charlie continues to stare at the picture. He finally places\nthe picture down on his\ndesk, and the camera pans upclose to the picture of Charlie when he was\naround six, being held by\nhis mother in her police uniform.\n\nCUT TO: INT. A BAR - NIGHT\n\nJOSH\nCampaigns aren't about the candidates.\n\nTOBY\nNo?\n\nJOSH\nThey're about the voters. How-how are we going to create jobs? how-how are\nwe going to get healthcare?\nHow are we going to make the lights go on? How are we going to protect\nourselves?\n\nTOBY\nDon't you want to ask if the plumber knows which directions the pipes\nrun? Don't you...? Forget the\nplumber. Don't... (sighs)... we want leadership to sound and feel like,\ninstead of appealing to\nour-our least expensive, however legitimate, desire to fell good about our\nselves? Don't we want...?\n\nDONNA\nAll right, that's it. I can't take it.\n\nTOBY\nHe started it.\n\nDONNA\nI am not kidding. I have such an impulse to knock your heads together. I\ncan't remember the last time\nI heard you two talk about anything other than how a campaign was playing\nin Washington. Cathy needed\nto take a second job so her dad could be covered by her insurance. She tried\nto tell you how bad\nthings were for family farmers. You told her we already lost Indiana. You\nmade fun of the fair but\nyou didn't see they have livestock exhibitions and give prizes for the\nbiggest tomato and the best\nheirloom apple. They're proud of what they grow. Eight modes of transportation,\nthe kindness of six\nstrangers, random conversations with twelve more, and nobody brought up\nBartlet versus Ritchie but\nyou. I'm writing letters, on your behalf to the parents of the kids who were\nkilled today. Can I have\nthe table, please?\n\nToby and Josh slowly get up fom the table. They walk over to a bar, where\na man is sitting there alone.\n\nMATT KELLEY\nFlight's delayed?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nMATT\nMe, too. I'm going to St. Louis.\n\nTOBY\nWashington.\n\nMATT\nI'm with my daughter. She's up, uh, stairs in the room, but we were out here\nlooking at Notre Dame.\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nMATT\nYou got kids?\n\nTOBY\nNo.\n\nMATT\nWait till you take your oldest to look at colleges. It's an incredible\nfeeling. You wish they'd go\nto college across the street from your house, but you know...\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nA Jack Daniels rocks.\n\nBARTENDER\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nMy boss went to Notre Dame.\n\nMATT\nBeautiful campus. I've never seen anything like it. She-she's not going to\nget to sleep tonight.\nYou see what happened in the market today?\n\nTOBY\nYeah, I-I saw. You invested?\n\nMATT\nEhh... Mutual fund that's supposed to send her to college. I never imagined\nat $55,000 a year, I'd\nhave trouble making ends meet. And my wife brings in another 25. My son's\nin public school. It's no\ngood. I mean, there's 37 kids in the class, uh, no art and music, no advanced\nplacement classes.\nOther kids, their mother has to make them practice the piano. You can't pull\nmy son away from the\npiano. He needs teachers. I spend half the day thinking about what happens\nif I slip and fall down\non my own front porch, you know? It should be hard. I like that it's\nhard. Putting your daughter\nthrough college, that's-that's a man's job. A man's accomplishment. But it\nshould be a little easier.\nJust a little easier. 'Cause in that difference is... everything. I'm\nsorry. I'm, uh, I-I'm Matt Kelley.\n\nTOBY\nI'm Toby Ziegler. I work at the White House. Have a minute to talk? We'd,\nuh... like to buy you a beer.\n\nMATT\nHey.\n\n\tA 5:05 - PRESIDENT MET WITH MR. McGARRY, CH. FITZWALLACE AND\n\tDR. McNALLY\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

I am, however, beginning to lean towards reducing ournuclear\naresenal one at a time,\nif you know what I mean, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat about you?\n\nFITZWALLACE\n[nodding at Nancy] Well, I'm with Dr. Strangelove on keeping our military\nsecrets secret. But Nancy\nand Leo and I think there's a third option, which is to say it was us but\ninsulate you.\n\nBARTLET\nI signed a piece of paper, Fitz.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWe can get around that.\n\nBARTLET\nYou just hated my living guts when I got this job, didn't you?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, you did. I didn't know anything and I didn't have any respect for the\nChiefs. You became my\ncounselor and you wrangled the Chiefs and you brought them to me.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYou got the Chiefs, sir, they respect you.\n\nBARTLET\nYou brought them to me. And you talked Leo into Shareef and he talked me\ninto it. It was my order\nand you executed it flawlessly and I stand by it. I stand by you, I stand\nby you all. I stand by\nit till I die. Plus, I'm going to need some cell mates in Holland. So,\nwhat do we do now?\n\nLEO\nWe're in the Situation Room.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. AIRPORT ROAD - NIGHT\nAn airport shuttle is seen driving down the road.\n\nCUT TO: INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS\nToby, Donna and Josh and several other passengers are inside the shuttle.\n\nJOSH\nYou're telling me, we couldn't have just gone to the nearest Chinese\nrestaurant, picked up some\nKikkoman and poured it into the soy diesel thing?\n\nDONNA\nI don't think it works like that. Plus, how close do you think the nearest\nChinese restaurant was?\n\nJOSH\nWell, we should start making cars that run on ketchup.\n\nDONNA\nWhen I get home, I'm taking the longest hot bath of my life.\n\nTOBY\n(to shuttle driver) Excuse me, would you mind letting me off up there at\nthe bridge?\n\nDRIVER\nAre you sure?\n\nTOBY\nYeah. I can walk to work from there.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, I'll hop out there, too.\n\nDONNA\nPlease, not this again.\n\nJOSH\nHey, you're the one who did the number back at the bar.\n\nDONNA\nIt didn't have anything to do with eliminating modern conviences.\n\nJOSH\nShe can drop you off at home.\n\nDONNA\nI'll get out with them up there.\n\nThe shuttle comes to a stop and TOBY, JOSH, and DONNA get off of the shuttle.\n\nTOBY\nIf our job teaches us anything, it's that we don't know what the next\nPresident's gonna face. And if\nwe choose someone with vision, someone with guts, someone with gravitas,\nwho's connected to other\npeople's lives, and cares about making them better... if we choose someone\nto inspire us, then we'll\nbe able to face what comes our way and achieve things... we can't imagine\nyet. Instead of telling\npeople who's the most qualified, instead of telling people who's got the\nbetter ideas, let's make\nit obvious. It's going to be hard.\n\nJOSH\nThen we'll do what's hard.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John Wells\nProductions, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

There are some calls I asked her to make.\n\nLEO\nI've told the President about the parachute.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nTommy, do they even make parachutes in Israel? They're saying it's an\nIsraeli-made parachute.\n\nTOMMY\nThey make 'em. They're good ones.\n\nBARTLET\nListen, I know we're here for a serious purpose, for a sober purpose, but\nI wanted to say\nI've never been a part of a street gang before, and that's basically what\nwe are -- a pretty\nwell-financed one -- but anyway, I wanted to say it feels good, and I think\nwhen we're done\nwith this meeting, I think we should go out and get girls, and I don't know,\nmaybe knock over\na fruit stand or something.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nWe're going to need to learn to sing and dance.\n\nLEO\nThe information is basically coming from the NSC operations unit.\n\nMAN\nA cell phone intercept between the Sultan and Habib. \"The Butcher of Kafr\nwill have no choice\nbut to resign.\"\n\nTOMMY\nAnd we're sure he's talking about Israel?\n\nMAN\n\"The Butcher of Kafr will have no choice but to resign.\"\n\nLEO\nWell, the B-movie dialogue aside...\n\nBARTLET\nToby and Josh are back.

Let's assume the Sultan goes to Al Jazeera and announces\nthat Shareef's plane\ndidn't go down accidentally-- that it was brought down by the Israelis. What\nare the options\nwe've come up with so far?\n\nMAN\nDo nothing.\n\nTOMMY\nWhich we can't do.\n\nMAN\nCall Qumar's bluff. Demand they produce proof.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWe can't call there bluff.\n\nMAN\nWhy?\n\nFITZWALLACE\n'Cause they're calling our bluff. When they produce manufactured proof,\nwe'd have to say, \"You\nmanufactured that.\" And they'd say, \"How do you know?\" So, the next option\nis we defend Israel.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're not curious why they're walking into DC?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nTOMMY\nWhat happens if Hezbollah launches a missile at Israel?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nIsrael attacks...\n\nBARTLET\nWalking into DC from where I guess you got to ask.\n\nLEO\nYou want to hunker down?\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, just for that, when it comes time to give out gang nicknames, you're\ngoing to be... I don't\nknow, but you're not going to have a good nickname.\n\nLEO\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nEllie had a teacher named Mr. Pordy, who had no interest in nuance.

OVER HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA\n\nC.J.\nThere are some 120 news outlets covering the hour-to-hour movements of the\nPresident. Only the cream\nof the crop ride here with me. The rest are consigned to the zoo plane where\nthey do not have moist\ntowelettes. This is why I'm so disappointed that with the exceptions of Terry,\nMike, Mark and Rachel,\nyou all misspelled Muhzriabolah.\n\nREPORTER\nI'm on television.\n\nC.J.\nIt was misspelled in your copy. I could tell.\n\nREPORTER\nSpeaking of copy-- is there an advance on the speech to the teachers?\n\nC.J.\nAn advance copy of text? You must be new.\n\nREPORTER\nCan you tell us what he's going to say about the pipe bombing?\n\nC.J.\nHe's obviously going to talk about it, but I don't know what he's going to\nsay. There's a filing center\nbehind the press riser. You'll have 50 minutes to file while the President\nmeets wit the Executive Board.\n\nREPORTER\nOpen to the pool?\n\nC.J.\nPool photos, that's it.\n\nKATIE\nHas he spoken to the University President?\n\nC.J.\nHe's spoken to Chancellor Bayless twice now, and the President's accepted\nan invitation to speak at the\nmemorial service on the KSU campus this Saturday.\n\nMARK\nAnything new from the FBI?\n\nC.J.\nWell, I'm still referring those questions to Zane Littleton at the FBI. But\nI do want to underline their\ninitial finding that it doesn't appear to have been an act of foreign\nterrorism.\n\nSTEVE\nAnd that's based on...?\n\nC.J.\nThe nature of the explosive. Okay, then. The flight to Battle Creek Air\nNational Guard Base is an hour\nand 45 minutes. It will be a 45 minute ride to Michigan State where the\nPresident will address the\ndelegates from the NEA for approximately 25 minutes.\n\nSTEVE\nI noticed Josh and Toby aren't on the plane. Are they still at a gas station\nin Unionville?\n\nC.J.\nNo, they made it home and their mother are very relieved. They've been given\na 4 hour vacation.\nAnything else? M-U-H-Z-I-R-I-A-B-O-L-A-H.\n\nC.J. walks out and heads down the plane when Bruno runs into her.\n\nBRUNO\nHe might get asked about Title IX.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nBRUNO\nRitchie mentioned yesterday it was worth reexamining so they'll ask him for\na reaction. You may\nwant to talk to Josh for first-thoughts.\n\nC.J.\nWhat are yours?\n\nBRUNO\nOn Title IX?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nBRUNO\nI have none. I'm indifferent.\n\nC.J.\nYou can't be indifferent.\n\nBRUNO\nI have to be. I have only so much RAM in my head. I have to prioritize. I\nhave to throw some things\noverboard, so, I've chosen, for instance, not to care whether or not Purdue\nhas a fencing team.\n\nBruno walks up to Sam who is standing together with Debbie.\n\nBRUNO\nSam.\n\nSAM\nBruno. This is Debbie Fiderer, the Presidents new Exec. This is Bruno Gianelli\nGeneral Chairman,\nCommittee to Re-Elect.\n\nDEBBIE\nHello.\n\nBRUNO\nHi. [to Sam, as Debbie gives him a look] The DC District Court is ruling\ntoday on a debate case.\nDo you know anything about it?\n\nSAM\nYeah, I think it's Sullivan v. Commission on Presidential Debates ABC, CBS,\nNBC News et al.\n\nBRUNO\nThis is the third party rule? 15%?\n\nSAM\nHappens every four years.\n\nBRUNO\nAll right.\n\nSAM\nThere are like 500 citizens lawsuits trying to get there guy in the debate. It\nnever goes anywhere.\n\nBRUNO\nAll right. [to Debbie] Fiderer's a funny name. It's not ha-ha funny, it's\njust, you know...\nOkay. [walks away]\n\nSAM\nSullivan v. Commission on Presidential Debates. Stay on it.\n\nBRUNO\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nIt's a guy suing, so Stackhouse can be in the debate.\n\nDEBBIE\nI thought Stackhouse was suppose to end up endorsing the President?\n\nSAM\nHe is. He will.\n\nDEBBIE\nWhy would he be in the debate?\n\nSAM\nPresumably he's endorsing the President becasue he knew he wouldn't be.\n\nDEBBIE\nHow bad would it be?\n\nSAM\nIt'd be bad. Which is why, even if, for some reason he was allowed in the\ndebate, he wouldn't do it.\nStackhouse isn't trying to hurt the President. But let's get back to you. Josh\nLyman's going to give\nyou a security briefing and an ethics briefing. Charlie's going to tell you\nsome things. You have\nprovisional clearance right now pending the succesful completion of the\nSF-86 and GC-1 background check.\n\nDEBBIE\nWhat is it?\n\nSAM\nIt's a questionaire. Extensive questions on your past, personal, professional,\nfinancial... pharmaceutical...\n\nDEBBIE\nNo, I know the form. What is a GC-1?\n\nSAM\nThey contact family members and friends and neighbors and former neighbors\nto corroborate.\n\nDEBBIE\nWell, this is fine but I've worked at the White House before. At my last job,\nthe background check wasn't\nnearly as extensive...\n\nSAM\nYou have a button on your phone, a crash button.\n\nDEBBIE\nHmm?\n\nSAM\nYou have a crash button which will bring the Secret Service in instantly\nand turn your office into a live\nmicrophone which will be broadcast all over the building. It's the button\nyou push if someone's trying to\ntake the Oval Office. This isn't your last job.\n\nC.J. comes out from the next room.\n\nC.J.\nSam, we need you in here.\n\nSAM\nExcuse me. [joins them]\n\nC.J.\nBruno thinks we dump the whole thing.\n\nBRUNO\nI think 44 people are dead and we can't give a speech on eduction.\n\nSAM\nI'm concerned that it's going to look opportunistic if we talk about Iowa\nat a campaign event. Plus,\nwe're using the teachers like props.\n\nC.J.\nHe's got to mention it, though.\n\nSAM\nYeah, he can't not mention it.\n\nBRUNO\nThere are dead children and then you segue to what?\n\nSAM\nI don't know.\n\nBRUNO\nI don't know either.\n\nSAM\nWhat are your feelings, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't know.

Cregg, with the First Lady,\nwith the President!\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nCan we return to the issue at hand? I'm going out of my mind with you two.\n\nSUSAN\nYou should call for federal funding of needle exchange in the five cities\nwith the highest\nincidence of AIDS. Ritchie has given you a perfect opening.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nWhen?\n\nSUSAN\nRight now. At the AMA. We've got an advanced copy of the text. That's what\nwe were arguing\nabout when you came in the meeting.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nWhat does he say?\n\nSUSAN\n\"We ought to begin and end with abstinence. We ought to begin and end with\npersonal responsibility.\nI'm appalled by inner city programs that hand out clean needles to junkies\nand dope-doers in the\nname of AIDS prevention and I will fight for a national law to end them.\"\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nAmy?\n\nAMY\nIt's baiting the hook. That's why they sent an advanced copy.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nYeah. But didn't I get in it to talk about things like this? Why not take\nthe bait?\n\nAMY\nThe bait's not for you. It's for the President. Ritchie wants you to respond\nso the President has to.\n\nSUSAN\nI thought the aim was to talk about issues that aren't being discussed. Not\nto run pass blocking\nfor the President.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nI feel like Susan has a point. It's an opportunity to get into some debate\nabout it.\nIf it was just me, nobody would be listening.\n\nSUSAN\nI don't know why you think the Committee to Re-elect needs us to protect\nthem. And if\nRitchie's strategy is what you say it is, won't Josh Lyman figure that out\nin five minutes?\n\nAMY\nIt'll take his assistant Donna five minutes.

Treating someone with HIV cost $200,000. I'd like\nsomeone to ask him\nthat. I'd like someone to ask him where the repsonsibility was in paraphernalia\nthat made it a\ncrime to buy or carry a syringe, which is why addicts share infected needles\nin the first place.\nI'd like someone to ask him that, too.\n\nLEO\nAll done?\n\nTOBY\nFor the moment.\n\nJOSH\nIt's really only a issue if Stackhouse responds, but if he does...\n\nSAM\nWill he?\n\nJOSH\nI don't know.\n\nLEO\nWill he?\n\nJOSH\nI don't know.

One on the\neconomy, one on foreign\npolicy, with another on global threats and national security, one on the\nenvironment, and one on\nstrengthening family life, which would include health care, education,\nand retirement. I also think\nthere should be one on parts of speech and sentence structure, and one\non fractions.\n\nC.J.\nIs there any chance I'm going to get an oppurtunity to speak in this\nconversation, or are you just\nwriting out loud?\n\nTOBY\nI didn't even know you were in the room.\n\nC.J.\nToby, I'm absolutely terrified we're going to lose the expectations game. I\ncan't believe how many\ntimes I get asked what would be a win in the debates. At this point I feel\nlike if -- and only if --\nRitchie accidentally lights his podium on fire does the President have a\nfighting chance.\n\nTOBY\nI disagree.\n\nC.J.\nDisagree all you want, but I'm right.\n\nTOBY\nThese two men are going to be side by side on the stage, answering\nquestions. That's the ball game.\n\nC.J.\nIf the whole thing is, he can't tie his shoelaces and it turns out he can,\nthen that is the ball game.\n\nTOBY\nAnd I believe he'll have to do more than tie his shoelaces.\n\nC.J.\nNot much more.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

For that, he gets this yarmulke which has been\ncrumpled up in my\ncoat pocket since a wedding in 1962. For everything else, the Medal of David.\n\nLEO\nThank you very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. A thousand dead relatives in\nScotland just started\ncrying. Thanks very much. [to reporters] We're a little late for lunch.\n\nLeo and Ben Yosef do a walk-and-talk in the HALLWAY.\n\nBEN YOSEF\nWhat the hell is going on, Leo? I'm reading Shareef is alive in Libya. That's\nyou people, right?\n\nLEO\nWe're thinking about starting our own tabloid.\n\nBEN\nWhat's happening at that house in Idaho?\n\nLEO\nIowa.\n\nBEN\nWhich one's the potatoes?\n\nLEO\nIdaho. We've had the house surrounded for 11 days. We're trying to negotiate\na surrender.\n\nBEN\nHow long can their supplies last?\n\nLEO\nThis people live to be well supplied, Ben.

Qumar is ready to announce it was Israel.\n\nBEN\nWe've known this was coming.\n\nLEO\nWell, it's come. And I need to put if off at least another week.\n\nBEN\nIsrael has to immediately deny the accusation.\n\nLEO\nI don't want there to be an accusation. I want it to wait another week.\n\nBEN\nAnd what are you asking Israel to give up in oder to get them to delay\naccusing us of something\nwe didn't do?\n\nLEO\nBen...\n\nBEN\nI'm just saying, tell me.\n\nLEO\nYou're planning to attack two Qumari training bases in retaliation...\n\nBEN\nYes, sir.\n\nLEO\nDon't.\n\nBEN\nThat's out of the question.\n\nLEO\nIf you hold off, Fitzwallace can get the Qumari Defense Minister to have\nthe Sultan hold off a week.\n\nBEN\nLeo, look at what's happening. They're getting you to pull us back by\ncontinuing this preposterous lie.\n\nLEO\nBut...\n\nBEN\nWe're not the ones playing skeet shoot with their cabinet.\n\nLEO\nNo, no, Ben. I think we're in this one together.\n\nBEN\nYes, I apologize for the remark.\n\nLEO\nWhen are you flying back?\n\nBEN\nRight after lunch.\n\nLEO\nYou can fly on the Sabbath?\n\nBEN\nIf I have to.\n\nLEO\nYou'll take it to the Prime Minister.\n\nBEN\nLeo, you know what you're doing?

We\ncan wait them out.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nGood.\n\nJOSH\nA guy told me I should take flying lessons cause it would relax me. I don't\nthink it you. Do you?\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nNo, Josh, I think you of all people shouldn't fly things.\n\nJOSH\nSenator...\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nYou brought the big guns.\n\nJOSH\nNot having any guns of my own. Obviously you know John Baxley -- Congressman\nBaxley ... Senators\nJackson and White, Secretaries Weaver and Keaton.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nAnd you all probably know Susan Thomas and Amelia Gardner.\n\nMICHAEL JACKSON\nHoward, it's getting hard for BFA staff to plan strategy without knowing\nexactly what hour you are\ngoing to drop out and endorse the President.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nWhat hour would be best for you. Michael? I'm inconviencing one of my\nopponents?\n\nJACKSON\nSerioulsy.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nYes?\n\nJACKSON\nI was very happy you did not respond on needle exchange.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nI haven't responded on needle exchange.\n\nJACKSON\nAnd I'm saying I'm happy about that.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nNo, I mean, it's not that I didn't-- It's that I haven't.\n\nSECRETARY JASON WEAVER\nAre you going to?\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nI don't know.\n\nWEAVER\nWell, what's your thinking?\n\nSUSAN THOMAS\nRegarding what, Jason?

And since the Sullivan ruling, things have gotten a bit\nmurkier.\n\nWHITE\nYou didn't get into this to hurt the President, Howard.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nI got in it to raise issues.\n\nWEAVER\nAnd I'm all for that.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nAs long as I don't in anyway speak.\n\nJOSH\nExcuse me.

[pause] The law-- seperation of church and state.\n\nCHARLIE\nWho told you that?\n\nANTHONY\nYou know exactly what I'm talking about.

I'm eating it on Red Mass. And I don't want to show it to Toby\nyet. Would you mind\nreading it for me and then hitting me in the head with a fairway wood?\n\nCHARLIE\nYep.\n\nWe follow Sam as he walks to the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.\n\nSAM\nJanet.

It does\nhave the flavor of me, the insouciance.\n\nJANET\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nSo guess what I've been asked to do?\n\nJANET\nValidators?\n\nSAM\nLine up validators.\n\nJANET\nAnd you're asking me?\n\nSAM\nYou're the third ranking non-male member of the minority on Ways and Means.\n\nJANET\nWell, when you say it like that.\n\nSAM\nListen, the economist are going to say it's good policy. College presidents\nare going to talk\nabout shrinking financial aid budgets.\n\nJANET\nWhere do you want me?\n\nSAM\nSunday mornings. I'll make you a book. Congratulations, Jeanette.\n\nJANET\nI'll do my best.\n\nSAM\nYour best is very good.\n\nJANET\nOh, by the way, I was just called. Horton Wilde is in the hospital. He's\nhad a heart attack.\n\nSAM\nHorton Wilde isn't the same as Thorton Wilder, is it?\n\nJANET\nI'm talking about California.\n\nSAM\n'Cause if Thornton Wilder had a heart attack, that would be remarkable news.\n\nJANET\nyou don't know who Horton Wilde is.\n\nSAM\nHe wrote \"Skin of Our Teeth.\"\n\nJANET\nHe's the Democrat running in the 47th. How is it possible that you don't\nknow who he is?\n\nSAM\nHas a Democrat won the California 47th in the last hundred years?\n\nJANET\nNo.\n\nSAM\nThat's how.\n\nJANET\nWell, maybe if when the Democrats had the White House there was a little\nmore attention paid...\n\nSAM\nTo Orange County? What kind?\n\nJANET\nKnowing the candidate's name, say. This was his fourth one by the way.\n\nSAM\nFourth what?\n\nJANET\nHeart attack.\n\nSAM\nThe Democrats have nominated someone who's had three heart attacks?\n\nJANET\nYes.\n\nSAM\nAnd you think I don't care enough about...? What kind of signal does this\nsend to...? I have to\ntalk... No, this isn't going to be a part of my life.\n\nJANET\nWow, you just did a whole thing all by yourself.\n\nSAM\nYeah, I do that.\n\nJANET\nThanks again for the opportunity.\n\nSAM\nI'll pass it on to Leo.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

And going by the last time the prescription was filled, he's been out\nfor six days.\n\nMAN 1\nMr. President, we fell the only way to save this boy is to abandon our plan\nand take the house now.\nWe think we'll be succesful.\n\nBARTLET\nHow do you do it?\n\nCASPER\nWe put a hole in the wall with a C-4 explosive. 12 men storm the house\nwearing special made\ngoogles and earplugs.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nCASPER\n'Cause they're going to throw flashbangs. A flashbang is about the size of\na grenade but instead\nof spraying shrapnel, it releases a deafening sound and releases a flash\nseven times brighter\nthan the sun.\n\nBARTLET\nYou hear that?\n\nLEO\nI've seen them.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere's the table?\n\nMAN 2\nWe're... all agreed, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right.

I'd vote for him too but he's not on the ballot\nin Conneticut or 22\nother states. Perhaps I should vote in New York or California where he's\npolling at four percent.\n\nAMY\nOf likely voters.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry?\n\nAMY\nThose polls sample likey voters.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nAMY\nWhen a third candidate get elected, it's going to be by unlikely voters.\n\nJOSH\nAnd why is that good? Why are we eager...Why are we encouraging a group of\npeople who are so\nhowl-at-the-moon, lazy-ass stupid that they can't bring themselves to raise\ntheir hands?\nWhy is it important that they be brought into the process?\n\nAMY\nYou should stop being mad at me.\n\nJOSH\nI'm not.\n\nAMY\nYou are. You know, I lost my job because of a strategy you organized.\n\nJOSH\nYou lost your job in a fashion that insured you 93 better offers.\n\nAMY\nThat's sweet of you to look out for me, but I liked the job I had. And when\nI lost it, I didn't\npitch anything. I didn't stage a nutty. I fought you, I lost, I had a drink,\nI took a shower.\n'Cause that's how it is in the NBA. You know what I do when I win? Two\ndrinks! I didn't start\nconsulting with Stackhouse to piss you off. There are things here I believe\nin. I didn't come\nout here to piss you off, either. I wanted to tell you that if the Senator\nresponds on needle\nexchange, the President shouldn't take the bait.\n\nJOSH\nNo kidding.\n\nAMY\nAll right, I'm going back in.\n\nJOSH\nHe's taking the President's votes. It's as simple... He is taking the\nPresident's votes.\n\nAMY\nListen, I'm not indifferent to the situation, but that right there, that's\nthe crazy part of\nyour argument.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nAMY\nThey're not his votes.\n\nAmy walks out of the room and closes the door.\n\nFADE OUT\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY\nDonna is sitting at her desk reading a book, when Josh walks up to her.\n\nJOSH\nHey.\n\nDONNA\nHuh? Hello.\n\nJOSH\nHow was it?\n\nDONNA\nI'm sorry?\n\nJOSH\nHow was it?\n\nDONNA\n[bewildered] It was...I don't know. It was... I don't... I don't think... maybe\nI'm not ready\nto talk about it yet.\n\nJOSH\nWhat was...?\n\nDONNA\nIt was a transforming... no, that's the wrong word. We are not \"transformed,\"\nwe \"locate the\nlight switch.\" I own myself, Josh. You don't mind if I say that out loud at\nfrequent intervals\nwith no provocation for a little while, do you?\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nDONNA\nBecause I live my life out loud.\n\nJOSH\nYou're reading the book?\n\nDONNA\nThe owner's manual.\n\nJOSH\nAre you serious?\n\nDONNA\nNo, you idiot! I need a shower!\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nDONNA\nI've got, like, radioactive stuff all over me.\n\nJOSH\nMan, and you call me a snob.\n\nDONNA\nOh, please. It was like a meeting for the There But For the Grace of God\nSociety.\n\nJOSH\nAnybody ask you out?\n\nDONNA\nShut up.\n\nJOSH\nSo, report to me-- what did he say?\n\nDONNA\nWhy is this important?\n\nThey walk into JOSH'S OFFICE.\n\nJOSH\nWhat did he say?\n\nDONNA\nThis is cheap.\n\nJOSH\nI'll say.\n\nDONNA\nI'm talking about this. So the guy's consulted for Ritchie. He's a buffoon,\nbut he's harmless.\nWhy should it be part of the campaign?\n\nJOSH\nBecause it's not harmless in an American President.\n\nDONNA\nNothing he said was wrong or objectionable. As suppose to the man who was\nsitting next to me\nwhose name was Fern.\n\nJOSH\nOpen this book to any page.\n\nJosh hands the book to Donna who opens the book and hands it back to Josh.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, well. This is an order form to buy \"Owning Yourself,\" follow-up to\nthe bestseller...\n\nDONNA\n\"Leasing Yourself.\"\n\nJOSH\n\"It's good to be trapped in a corner. That's when you act.\"\n\nDONNA\nThat happens to be true.\n\nJOSH\nIt is. In my case, it's the only time that I do.\n\nDONNA\nSo?\n\nJOSH\nIt's Immanuel Kant! \"Duty! Sublime and mighty name, that embraces nothing\ncharming or insinuating\nbut requires submission.\" Every year a million freshman philosophy students\nread that sentence.\n\nDONNA\nAnd change their major?\n\nJOSH\nYou've just got a mouth full of wiseass today, don't you?\n\nDONNA\nI located the lightswitch.\n\nJOSH\nCould you locate it again?\n\nDONNA\nSo he cripped Kant. Isn't that what you're suppose to do?\n\nJOSH\nIt comes from a 193-page book called \"A Critique of Practical Reason.\" It's\nabout metaphysica and\nepistemology. Tomba's impressively boiled it down to two-thirds of one\npage. Give me another one.\n\nDONNA\n\"Look outside the cave.\"\n\nJOSH\nRight. That's from an old paperback called \"The Republic\" by Plato. Lucky\nTomba's been able to\nfit on fortune cookie so it suits the attention span of the Republican\nnominee. Here he quotes\nRobert Frost. \"Good fences make good neighbors.\" Did he talk about that?\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWhat did he say?\n\nDONNA\nBasically, that if you stay within your personal space, you'll end up getting\nalong with everyone.\n\nJOSH\nYou had to study modern poetry.\n\nDONNA\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nIs that what Frost meant?\n\nDONNA\nNo, he meant that boundries are what alienate us from each other.\n\nJOSH\nWhy did he say \"Good fences make good neighbors?\"\n\nDONNA\nHe was being ironic, but I still don't see...\n\nJOSH\nWhat does this remind you of? \"I believe in hope, not fear.\" \"I'm a leader,\nnot a politician.\"\n\"It's time for an American leader.\" \"America's earned a change.\" \"I before\n'E' except after 'C'!\"\nIt's the fortune-cookie candidacy! These are important thinkers, and\nunderstanding them can be\nvery useful and it's not ever going to happen at a four-hour seminar. When\nthe President's got\nan embassy surrounded in Haiti, or a keyhole photograph of a heavy water\nreactor, or any of the\nfifty life-and-death matters that walk across his desk every day, I don't\nknow if he's thinking\nabout Immanuel Kant or not. I doubt it, but if he does, I am comforted at\nleast in my certainty\nthat he is doing his best to reach for all of it and not just the McNuggets. Is\nit possible we\nwould be willing to require any less of the person sitting in that chair? The\nlow road? I don't\nthink it is.\n\nDONNA\nAll right. I'll go through the book this weekend, highlight somethings and\nI'll trace it back.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, make sure you...\n\nDONNA\nI said I'd do it, Buckminster!\n\nJOSH\nA guy named Fern?\n\nDONNA\nDon't talk to me about Fern.\n\nJOSH\nYou sure it wasn't Vern?\n\nDONNA\nNo. I thought it was Vern but it's Fern.\n\nJOSH\nLet me know when the report gets in.\n\nDonna walks out of Josh'S office, but looks back before she rounds the corner.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

He's had a heart attack.\n\nLEO\nI'm sorry to hear that. We'll send something.\n\nSAM\nIt's his fourth. In the Idaho 2nd we're running a guy who lost the race for\ncity council. In the\nTexas 22nd our candidate's an electrical engineer who paid his filing fee\nby dumping the cash out\nof a cigar box. The Arizona 6th features a Democrat who nine weeks ago,\nregistered as... a Democrat.\n\nLEO\nYou just named three districts that are impossible for Democrats.

Agence-France.\n\nLEO\nThen you've read that Qumar's reopened the investigation into Abdul Shareef's\nplane going down.\n\nSAM\nYeah. Watch. They're going to say Israel had something to do with it.\n\nLEO\nDo you think they did?\n\nSAM\nWhat do I know? Shareef was a bad guy. Feels like he had money in the\nBahji cell.\n\nLEO\nHe did. He was also behind the plot to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nSAM\nBridges and tunnels. That's my nightmare. What's yours?\n\nLEO\nWell, now it's bridges and tunnels, Sam.\n\nSAM\nThen my work here is done.\n\nLEO\nIt's that I don't know what winning looks like. What does it look like. Is\nit... I mean, is it\nhonestly the U.S. flag flying over Mecca? Is that what's going to straighten\nthis out? And if\nthat's the case, why are we postponing that? What are we hoping is going\nhappens in the meantime?\n\nSAM\nThat somebody will think of something before we have to do the unthinkable.\n\nLEO\nYou're one of the big minds of your generation.

Don't try to force it.

Mike, pick yourself out a daughter. My\noldest is married,\nbut I can have it annulled. The Pope said he'd do it, I swear to God.\n\nCASPER\nThat's very friendly of you, sir. Thank you.\n\nBARTLET\nJerry, ws that note anything I need?\n\nJERRY\nI don't know. Israeli Search and Rescue's looking for a transport that fell\noff the radar about\ntwelve hours, uh, 12 hours and 22 minutes into the flight-- about 15,\num... I'm sorry, about 25\nminutes before it was scheduled to land at Ben Gurion airport.\n\nBARTLET\nWhere did it originate?\n\nJERRY\nIt originated um... oh, God. Mr.President, I think Ben Yosef is on that\nplane. I think...\n\nLEO\nHe is.\n\nMORRIS\nDid they give coordintes?\n\nJERRY\n33-51 North, 34-47 East.\n\nWOMAN\n34-47...\n\nJERRY\nIt's Lebanon, right?\n\nMORRIS\nYeah, southern Lebanon.\n\nJERRY\nAt any rate, Mr. President, the, uh, S and R's just gotten underway.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay. Somebody will keep me posted.\n\nJERRY\nYes, sir.\n\nCASPER\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nMike? No kidding, thank you.\n\nCASPER\nThank you, sir.\n\nCasper and crew exit the Oval Office.\n\nLEO\nBen Yosef's plane is missing. Now, how did I not see that coming?\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tSUNDAY NIGHT\n\nA football game is playing on the TV. Bartlet is lounging on the couch,\nwhile C.J. sits across\nfrom him in a chair.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, call that play on first down again, Coach 'cause I'm sure they're not\nready for it this time.\nYou know, if you ask a professional athlete what the hardest thing is to do\nin sports, they'll all\nsay \"hit a baseball.\" But a coach once told me that the hardest thing to do\nin sports is to walk\ninto your Super Bowl locker room at half-time and change the strategy that\ngot you there 'cause\nit's no longer working.\n\nC.J.\nIt's really okay that after almost every play, somebody requires medical\nattention?\n\nBARTLET\nIt's not even the number of debates, as much as the format. 2 minute response\nfollowed by a 1\nminute reply. That's not a debate. That's not a debate! It's a joint press\nconference.\n\nSam enters.\n\nSAM\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nNice job on the Red Mass. First rate.You don't mind if I change everything,\ndo you?\n\nSAM\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHere... here... and I added a section here.\n\nSAM\nAh! Cute. Let's take a look. [sits down to read]\n\nBARTLET\nIt's a joint press conference. It's not neccesary for the candidates to be\nin the same room.\nThat part's just theater.\n\nC.J.\n[to Sam] We're talking about ways to possibly lower expectations.\n\nSAM\nI like what you did. I like the 80-20.\n\nBARTLET\nBe nice to be able to respond to what the other person has said, and ask\nthem a question. And\nthe moderator should be empowered to press for an answer, just as a judge\ncan of a witness,\nor a member of Congress in a confirmation hearing.\n\nSAM\nHmm.\n\nC.J.\nSam, what do you think about me writing you an urgent memo? \"I think Ritchie's\na more skilled\ndebater than we're anticipating. He has, after all, debated three gubernatorial\ncandidates and\nwon each time.\"\n\nSAM\nAnd leak the memo?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nI think you'll look silly.\n\nC.J.\nI'm used to that.\n\nSAM\nI don't think it'll do much.\n\nC.J.\nMe, neither.\n\nBARTLET\nCicero wanted to restore the overthrown king of Egypt, and the Roman Senate\ndebated all day and\ninto the night, every military and diplomatic consequence until they collapsed\non the Senate floor.\nLentulus is trying to overthrow the Republic. Ceaser goes up against Cato--\nby the way, in the very\nfirst public debate on the death penalty. They were against each other,\nit was a debate and they\nexplored the meaning of spirituality and suffering.\n\nSAM\nAnd then they put Lentulus to death.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's right, but my point...\n\nC.J.\nWhy not?\n\nBARTLET\nWhy not, what?\n\nC.J.\nAsk for a different format. We didn't get the number of debates we wanted,\nso why not ask for a\ndifferent format?\n\nBARTLET\nWe'd never get it.\n\nC.J.\nWe might.\n\nBARTLET\nThe Ritchie people wold put up too much of a fight.\n\nC.J.\nThey might consider it. The might consider it if we give them something else\nthey wanted.\n\nBARTLET\nOther then this House, we don't have anything else they want.\n\nSAM\nSure we do. Sure we do. We wanted five debates, they wanted none. We have\nexactly one thing\nleft that they want.\n\nBARTLET\nWow. Isn't this exactly why casino's don't play with a one-deck shoe?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nCharlie enters.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nHmm...\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President, the car's ready.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's still running that screen pass. Get Toby to sign off, and I'm in.\n\nBartlet and Charlie exit into the RESIDENCE HALLWAY.\n\nBARTLET\nThis is going to be interesting. Do I need my speech?\n\nCHARLIE\nI've got it. You mind if I ask you something about Red Mass I'm curious about?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. PORTICO - CONTINUOUS\nCharlie and Bartlet walk out of the residence onto the portico where we pick\nthem up in the\nmiddle of their conversation that was started in the residence.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd so how isn't it a Constitutional issue? It is, but sometimes you say,\n\"Big deal.\" It was\nthe intention not to have a national religion, not to have anyone's religious\nviews imposed\non anyone else, and not to have the government encourage a national display\nof piety as a\nsubstitute for real action. I'll be in the office a minute.\n\nCHARLIE\nThank you.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nCharlie enters from the portico.\n\nEMILY\nHey... this was dropped at the Northwest gate for you just now.\n\nCHARLIE\nWho's it from?\n\nEMILY\nI don't know.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt's from Anthony. He's the one who was here yesterday.\n\nCharlie reads the note.\n\nEMILY\nNice note?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, at several points he suggest that I might have an improper relationship\nwith my mother.\n\nEMILY\nWhy are you smiling?\n\nCHARLIE\nHe wrote it on the back of the First Amendment.\n\nCharlie walks out to the HALLWAY.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, Josh, why can't the Mets throw strikes when they've got a three- one lead?\n\nJOSH\nYeah, let me ask you another. With a runner on first who's a threat to steal,\nwhy don't you...\n\nJosh notices Amy sitting in The Mural Room.\n\nCHARLIE\nSee you.\n\nJOSH\nOkay.\n\nJosh enters THE MURAL ROOM.\n\nJOSH\nHey.\n\nAMY\nOh, hey. I didn't... Hi. My mind was wondering.\n\nJOSH\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nAMY\nI'm sorry?\n\nJOSH\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nAMY\nDanya Zucker had an extra ticket for the Mass, and she asked me. Are you going?\n\nJOSH\nNo... No.\n\nJosh leads Amy outside to the PORTICO.\n\nJOSH\nCan you give me any indication, what's the senator's thinking?\n\nAMY\nI really can't. He spoke to me for a while yesterday, and... again today,\nand I don't know what\nhe's thinking, but... I can tell you what I told him at the end.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nAMY\nI told him I thought he'd been an extraordinary public servant--thoughtful\nand energetic and\ncompassionate and courageous, and I told him I'd be voting for the President.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nAMY\nFirst of all, I'm crazy about the President, Josh. I've been crazy about\nhim for longer than\nyou've known who he was. And I'll keep poking him with a stick. That's how\nI show my love.\nBut... as a women's issue, it's a no-brainer. The next Justice can overturn\nRoe and... you\ndon't screw around with that. Hey, you want to see what I learned to do\nsince you got me fired?\n\nJOSH\nLook...\n\nAMY\nWatch.\n\nAmy pulls a balloon out of her pocket and blows it up.\n\nAMY\nRight away that's impressive, right? But that's just the preparaation. This\nis he thing.\n\nAmy twists and folds the balloon into what many say resembles an abstract\npenis.\n\nJOSH\nWhat is it?\n\nAMY\nWhat do you want it to be?\n\nDANYA [OS]\nAmy?\n\nAMY\nOut here. [to Josh] I'll see you.\n\nAmy goes back inside leaving Josh out on the portico.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SHRINE OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION - NIGHT\nThe choir is singing Vilvadi's \"Gloria.\"\n\nCHOIR\n\"Gloria, gloria\nGloria, gloria\nIn excelsis Deo\nIn Excelsis deo...\"\n\nSAM\nI was thinking about what you asked me before, about have I been able to\nthink of anything and\nI said, \"No.\" And you said, \"Neither have I or neither has the President.\"\n\nLEO\nWhat about it?\n\nSAM\nI wouldn't speak for anybody else but you know I'm not done yet, right?\n\nLeo looks at Sam then looks down to the yarmulke he is holding in his hand,\nthat was given to\nhim by Ben Yosef. The choir is still singing Vivaldi's \"Gloria.\" The\ncongregation stands as the\nCardinal makes his procession down the aisle. Music ends.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. COURTYARD OUTSIDE OF CHURCH - NIGHT\nWe pan down from a stainglass window to C.J. sitting on a bench outside. Toby\nwalks from inside\nto church to C.J.\n\nC.J.\nToby...\n\nTOBY\nNope. Stay there. I'm first looking for something to beat you with.\n\nC.J.\nLook...\n\nTOBY\nI'm going to do it with my hands.\n\nC.J.\nLet me tell you something.\n\nTOBY\nOne debate?\n\nC.J.\nWhat's really the difference between one debate and two debates?\n\nTOBY\nWhat's the difference betw...? It's a whole other debate. It's a second\ndebate! It's 100% more debate!\n\nC.J.\nSomeone should ask him if he's aware taxpayers pay $9,000 this instead of\n$200,000 that.\nAnd somebody should ask him what he means by, and somebody should ask him\nhow he plans on...\"\nYou said that, and you were right!\n\nTOBY\nWhat if he has a bad night? It's happened. What if he gets himself into\ntrouble? What if Ritchie\ncomes after Abbey or the kids and the President goes postal? That's what\nI'd try to do. Stress,\nhot lights... What if he has an episode?\n\nC.J.\nWe lose. When you can't lower expectations, you only have one thing you can\ndo. You have to meet them.\n\nToby turns around to think. He turns back around.\n\nTOBY\nClear 24 hours from the President's schedule. We're going away.\n\nC.J. gives him a silent thank you, then walks back into the CHURCH FOYER.\n\nSUSAN\nThere she is. C.J.!\n\nC.J.\nSusan.\n\nSUSAN\nThe Senator would like a quick word with the President. Is that possible?\n\nC.J.\nWell, I don't know, Susan.\n\nSUSAN\nHe should.\n\nC.J.\nOkay.\n\nC.J. walks into the sanctuary up to Bartlet who is conversing with men of\nthe chruch. She whispers\nin his ear and Bartlet follows her to the CHURCH STEPS where Senator Stackhouse\nis waiting.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nThat was a wonder talk, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you. I didn't write much of it.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nThe 80-20 section.\n\nBARTLET\nThat part I wrote. I added it.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nWhen you first started... You talk about how much politicians hunger after\nthe 80-20 issue, I thought,\n\"My God, I'm about to watch a train wreck. He's going to make a political\nspeech to the Supreme Court\nwhile standing in the middle of a church.\" But of course you didn't. I\nshould've known better. \"Who\namong the 80 will stand up for the 20?\"\n\nBARTLET\nYou did, Howard. You did all the time.\n\nSTACKHOUSE\nI was telling Josh Lyman about a friend who just got his pilot's license. He\ntold me the most\nremarkable thing. He said a new pilot will fly into cloud cover. There'll\nbe no visibility.\nAnd they'll check their gauges, they'll look at the artificial horizon,\nit'll show them level,\nbut they won't trust it. So, they'll make an adjustment and then another\nand another... He said\nthe number of new pilots who fly out of clouds completely upside-down would\nknock you out.\nMy office will make arrangements for me to endorse you in the morning. You\nkeep your eyes on\nthe horizon, Mr. President.\n\nStackhouse turns around and walks down the front steps. Bartlet ignoring\nthe reporters calling\nhis name, watches Stackhouse as he crosses the street and disappears into\nthe crowd.\n\nSECRET SERVICE AGENT\nAre you ready to go, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nNo. C.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nWould it be possible to move the press off the church grounds? I'm going to\ntake questions for\na little while.\n\nC.J.\nOn what?\n\nBARTLET\nNeedle exchange.\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir.\n\nC.J. walks down the church steps up to the press.\n\nC.J.\nIf you'll move off the church grounds. Just move back.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John Wells\nProductions, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

The rest of the\nstaff,\nCongresswoman Andy Wyatt, Joey Lucas and Kenny, are sitting in the audience\nlistening.\n\nBARTLET\nAffirmative action and quotas are about two different things. Affirmative\naction is about\nproviding people an opportunity they might not otherwise get.\n\nSAM\nI don't know how you can talk about providing opportunity, while at the same\ntime supporting\nracial profiling.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat that hell is...? I don't support racial profiling.\n\nSAM\nYour nominee for Attorney General did. Can you tell us why you nominated him?\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\n'Cause bite me, that's why.\n\nALL\nWhoa...\n\nC.J.\nIt's a legitamate question.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's been almost four years Sam, how long do you want to say \"I told you so?\"\n\nJOSH\nHe wasn't saying \"I told you so,\" sir.

Mr. President, do you mind if I...?\n\nJOSH\nNo...\n\nBARTLET\nI think she was talking to me there, Dexter. What?\n\nANDY\nA lot of people in law enforcement believe profiling helps them do their\njob better.\nNot everyone's against it.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm against it.\n\nJOEY (KENNY)\nAnd so are the voters, but I think what...\n\nBARTLET\nHow you doing there Joey? Kippy?\n\nJOSH\nKenny.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nJOEY (KENNY)\nI think, Mr. President, that what Congresswoman Wyatt was saying is that if\nwe can figure\nout a way to make this answer about the drug war, then we can talk about\nsuccesses.\n\nBARTLET\nIs that what you were saying, Andy?\n\nANDY\nYes, sir.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but Richie will bring it back to Rooker and the fact that you don't\nknow what your\nposition on racial profiling...\n\nBARTLET\nI do know what my position is.\n\nTOBY\nWe're losing the question. Fundamentally, it's \"What was the story with\nRooker?\"\n\nC.J.\nWe gave him our full support until it became clear that an increasingly\ndivided Congress\nwas going to shoot down our nominee.\n\nTOBY\nWe didn't give him our full support.

It's talent night here at Debate Camp,\nanybody want to\ndo a little skit?\n\nLeo hands Bartlet the note, then whispers into his ear. Bartlet reads the\nnote.\n\nBARTLET\nApparently, eight Israeli Thunder fighters--these are also known as\nAmerican-made Boeing F15E\nStrike Eagles--have hit two terrorist bases in the north and south of\nQumar. And while no Qumari\ngovernment personel or institutions were destroyed, Qumar, of course,\nconsiders an attack on its\nsoil to be an act of war. So we are, as always, one bad bottle of Tequila\naway from all-out war\nin West Asia. (to Sam) Would you like to take this one or shall I?\n\nSAM\nWhy don't you get this one.

If Israel feels threatened by them, what happens?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThey launch a pre-emptive strike.\n\nLEO\nYeah, but before that happens, Qumar shows its teeth, right?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nYeah.

Amy's cell phone\nis ringing,\nbut she is ignoring it.\n\nPETER HARLOW\nI have to say you look good.\n\nAMY\nThank you.\n\nPETER\nI don't remember you looking this good. Is something different?\n\nAMY\nI don't know, the autumnal equinox is usually good to me, but...\n\nPETER\nI think that's your cell phone that's been ringing.\n\nAMY\nYes. Excuse me. (answers her phone) Hello?\n\nJOSH (VO)\nHey.\n\nAMY\nHello.\n\nJOSH (VO)\nYou on your date?\n\nAMY\nWell, I wouldn't call it that.\n\nJOSH\nListen, you probably don't want to let him know it's me on the phone. It's\ntoo intimidating.\nIt's like going out with Cher and Sonny calls.\n\nAMY\nHow can I help you?\n\nJOSH\nAny thoughts?\n\nAMY\nYes, Ritchie's right. There's a family crisis in America.\n\nJOSH\nSo a radical feminist is saying women should stay home with the kids?\n\nAMY\nFirst of all, I don't think I'm a radical anything. Second of all, who said\nwomen should stay home?\nAnd third is, it's the capitalist treadmill that encourages scheduling\nquality time on a Palm Pilot.\nThat's not how they do it in Scandinavia.\n\nJOSH\nBut everybody kills themself in Scandinavia.\n\nAMY\nThat's hard to deny.\n\nJOSH\nWe need to defend our accomplishments on work and family, many of which you\npushed for and show\nthat we get what working parents are going through. Can you help us?\n\nAMY\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nI'll call back. What would be a really bad time?\n\nAMY\nOh, really anytime.\n\nJOSH\nOutstanding.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I realize it's not a\ngood idea for a White\nHouse staffer to be saying there's a missile in the capitol.\n\nMICHAEL\nWell, the problem is, joke or not, she it a little close to him for our\ncomfort.\n\nJOSH\nWhat do you mean?\n\nMICHAEL\nObvioulsy I can't elaborate.\n\nJOSH\n\"She hit a little close to home\"?\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nYou trying to tell me...?\n\nMICHAEL\nMr. Lyman, you don't have code-word clearance. We need to stay professional.\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow long has she been working for you?\n\nJOSH\nListen, this... this is silly. She was just duped. It was a joke.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow long has she been working for you?\n\nJOSH\nThis is a giant misunderstanding.\n\nMICHAEL\nMr. Lyman...\n\nJOSH\nI would vouch for Donna with my life. She doesn't know about missiles. She's\nfrom Wisconsin!\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm simply asking how long she's been working for you.\n\nJOSH\nNo, look, I'm sorry. I'm sure your intentions are good, and this is just\nroutine, but it could\nget tricky, and I'd like to have her talk to someone.\n\nMICHAEL\nA lawyer?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL\nSuit yourself, but until this is straightened out, I'm going to have to\nrevoke her credentials.\n\nJOSH\nShe's my assistant. For how long?\n\nMICHAEL\nAs long as it takes.\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nMICHAEL\nThank you.\n\nMichael leaves Josh's office. Josh walks to his door and calls Donna.\n\nJOSH\nDonna...\n\nDONNA\nWhat was that?\n\nJOSH\nYou got to go home.\n\nDONNA\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\nThat idiot interview you did, pooped a red flag at NSA. They're revoking\nyour credentials\nuntil it's straightened out.\n\nDONNA\nI don't believe it.\n\nJOSH\nI'm talking to someone in Cochran's office.\n\nDONNA\nWhat am I suppose to do?\n\nJOSH\nTake a few days off. Go home. Go to the beach.\n\nDONNA\nIt's February 2nd.\n\nJOSH\nWell, then, I wouldn't go to the beach.\n\nDONNA\nYou've got a meeting in Leo's office.\n\nJOSH\nDon't worry about this.

Listen up. We still have an open question on family, we still\nhave an open question\non Rooker, missile defense, and vouchers. We start dress rehearsals tomorrow\nat 3:00. Let's\nsplit up in our groups.

It does it in 60 seconds.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThe global positioning device on the MLRS is how we found the ship. This is\nthe message in a\nbottle we've been waiting for.\n\nBARTLET\nThey turn around the ship in exchange for what?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nAccess to the High Altitude Area Defense program.\n\nLEO\nThat's okay, 'cause that's just the most sophisticated anti-ballistic missile\nsystem in\nhistory short of Star Wars. What else?\n\nBARTLET\nThey're arming the Bahji, Leo. Two training camps of which the Israelis just\nattacked.\nI've gotta turn around the boat-- tonight. Tomorrow we'll worry about\ntomorrow.\n\nLEO\nWell, we can invite the Sultan over for a mixer.\n\nBARTLET\nLook...\n\nLEO\nA nice mixer. Punch, sack races, whatnot... Why are we playing games with\nthese people? They\nrefuse to catch and prosecute the Bahji. In fact, they support them in a\nvariety of ways.\nWhy isn't that the end of the conversation? \"We'll worry about tomorrow,\ntomorrow.\" We said\nthat yesterday.\n\nBARTLET\nFitz?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nI couldn't agree with Leo more.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat about Nancy?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's available from the Sixth Fleet?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nOne Forward Unit east of the Mastico-- the 26th Marine Expeditionary.\n\nBARTLET\nStop the boat.

Our report card for our first two weeks in office. The President's\napproval has\ngone from 61% during the transition-- when, I suppose, there's nothing to\napprove-- to 49%\nonce there was. 47% see him as a strong leader-- a result of bungling the\nRooker nomination--\nand African-American support, which basically elected him, has gone from 92\nto 78. Finally,\nif the election were held today, the President would be Chairman of the\nEconomics Department\nat Phillips Andover Academy. Can anyone report anything good?\n\nC.J.\n600,000 Evangelicals are praying for me... so... we have that going for us.\n\nLEO\nWhat the hell are yoy talking about?\n\nC.J.\nIt's true-- a guy gave me this card: \"365 in Media.\"\n\nSAM\nWho are the others?\n\nC.J.\nI don't know, let's see... \"Hugh Hefner, Don Imus, Howard Stern...\" all the\nlate-night guys.\nThis is... one, two, three... this is the Editorial Board of The New York\nTimes. This isn't a\ngood list, this is a list of people who are going to hell!\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nThey're not praying for me because they like me! It's 'cause I'm doomed to\neternal damnation!\n\nSAM\nWell, if you weren't, it'd be a waste of praying.\n\nC.J.\nYou're on the list too, pal.\n\nSAM\nCan I see that?\n\nLEO\nYou can all leave.\n\nJOSH\nWe're going to do better for you, boss.\n\nLEO\nDo better for him.\n\nC.J.\nWe will.\n\nTOBY\nWe will.\n\nJosh and Sam walk out to the HALLWAY.\n\nJOSH\nSam...\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nCan you walk with me a second?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nWell, you were right, I was wrong.\n\nSAM\nMore often then not, it's going to be the other way around, so...\n\nJOSH\nThanks. Listen, I got a weird problem.\n\nSAM\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nRemember Donna had lunch with Mack's assistant a few weeks ago? He told her\nthere's a missile\nsilo on the grounds. She repeated it to a magazine and an NSA guy came to\nsee me just now, and\nsaid she struck a little close to home and they want to investigate. In the\nmeantime, they've\nrevoked her credentials.\n\nSAM\n\"Struck to close to home.\" What does that mean?\n\nJOSH\nIt means somehow she... There's actually some kind of weapons system right\nhere on the White\nHouse... or... intelligence gathering... Wait a minute. This doesn't sound\nright.\n\nJosh stops in the NORTHWEST LOBBY and thinks about what he's saying. He\nturns to Sam then walks\noff to his BULLPEN, where he's sees Donna sitting with Michael Gordon at\nher desk.\n\nJOSH\nHi.\n\nDONNA\nHey. Just... hanging with my friend Michael. He works in the staff secretary's\noffice. Plus,\nhe's got his own band. By the way, you know what your name is for the next\nmonth?\n\nJOSH\nIt's going to be bambi, isn't it?\n\nDONNA\nYeah, it's going to be Bambi-ass. But on your good days, I'm calling you Abner\n'cause you\nstepped into the White House and didn't flinch.\n\nJosh shakes Michael's hands then begins to walk to his office leaving Donna\nwearing the smile\nof victory.\n\nJOSH\nI'm making phone calls.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

I want women to have help from the\ngovernment. I want\nwomen to earn what men earn. I want everyone to earn enough so that everyone\ncan make the\nright choice for their family, and after that, it's none of your business\nwho stays home and\nwho goes to work. You don't know more about raising a family than I do.\n\nJOSH\nThat was it. We got it. We'll give it a test. I'll call you back. Probably\naround 1:00.\n\nAMY\nA.M.?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nAMY\nGood.\n\nJosh hangs up.\n\nJOSH\nLet's get that in the form of an answer.\n\nToby walks in with Charlie.\n\nC.J.\nWe got something from Amy.\n\nTOBY\nGood.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe was wondering, the Team Toby meeting. Toby doesn't need to be there, right?\n\nTOBY\nI wasn't really wondering.\n\nJOSH\nWhy don't you just do your job as a man and get that nice girl pregnant.\n\nTOBY\nI did.\n\nJOSH\nWait, what?\n\nC.J.\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\nAndy's pregnant.\n\nJOSH\nToby, Andy's pregnant?\n\nTOBY\nWith twins.\n\nSAM\nThis is incredible.\n\nJOSH\nAnd they're yours?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nBoth of them?\n\nTOBY\nI'm going downstairs.\n\nToby leaves, and C.J. hits Josh for asking such a stupid question.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, we're going to have to step this up now.\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nLet's go.\n\nJosh, Charlie, and C.J. leave to go the DEBATE ROOM. Sam is in the room\nalone when Bartlet enters.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nSAM\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nDid you have a good day?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir. We haven't found the answer we like on the Rooker question yet.\n\nBARTLET\nYou know what I remember he said to me? He said, \"Mr. President, when I hear\nblack footsteps\nbehind me, I'm scared. When I hear white footsteps, I'm not.\"\n\nSAM\nWell, I think we both know people who's say different. But you have to\nrespect him for voicing\nsuch an unpopular opinion amongst people to whom he's a leader.\n\nBARTLET\nYou pay for these things for such a long time. Too long, don't you think?\n\nSAM\nI absolutely do... And I don't know why we struggle with it.\n\nBARTLET\nWe made a mistake... I corrected it. I'll make more.\n\nSAM\nYes. Humans can't rebut that. It's prevent defense and has the added merit\nof being true.\n\nBARTLET\nAm I going to lose New Hampshire?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't mind blowing the knucklehead stuff like Rooker... Rooker's not\nknucklehead, but...\nif I'm making mistakes there, how do I know I'm not doing it when it comes\nto matters like\ndeath and destruction?\n\nSAM\nWell, probably you don't, 'cause there's no manual. Sir, we expect the\nPresident to face the\nworld in his own way, for his own time. Also, luckily for all of us, you\nhave better advisors\nin that area than you do in domestic and political policy.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. When we're done tonight, we should talk about moving money to Ohio.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir, and maybe making a stop in Orange County. You know, our candidate\nin the 47th\nis such a dynamo that he's in the hospital with his fourth heart attack.\n\nBARTLET\nNot anymore. He's dead.\n\nSAM\nOkay.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go.\n\nThey begin to walk down the stairs to the DEBATE AREA.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd stay up in my face, okay?\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI swear to God, the winner of this debate's going to be the next\nPresident. Anybody want\nto be on the losing team?\n\nALL\nNo, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThen let's pump it up. Let's go, Claudia Jean.\n\nC.J.\nGood evening, and welcome to the Presidential debate between President Josiah\nBartlet and\nGovernor Robert Ritchie being brought to you from the Univerisity of\nCalifornia, San Diego.\nThe format agreed to by both candidates, is as follows: A candidate will\nhave 90-seconds to\nrespond, followed with a 60-second questioning by his opponent, followed by\n60-second\nsummation.

What... any... um... All\nright, I'm not going to say that. I'll just go right to... No, I don't. I\nthink you\nknow that I'm opposed.... [sighs] Let's not do that. I haven't seen any\nevidence that\nit's a deterrent, and there are more effective... In my state...\n\nTOBY\nOh, my God.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat?\n\nTOBY\n[to Leo] You weren't kidding. [to Bartlet] What's the matter with you? When\nI left\nyou... I just mentioned your daughter being murdered, and you're giving us\nan answer\nthat's not only soporific, it's barely human! Yes, you'd want to see him\nput to death.\nYou'd want it to be cruel and unusual, which is why it's probably a good\nidea that\nfathers of murder victims don't have legal rights in these situations. Now,\nwe're\ngoing back to school.\n\nThere is a long pause of silence, then they all begin to laugh.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go-- ten bucks. Crisis of confidence.

It's charcoal and blue.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, I decided to go ahead and wear my lucky tie.\n\nCHARLIE\nAre you sure?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nThis tie feels pretty lucky to me.\n\nBARTLET\nThen it's your lucky tie. Why don't you get mine, and we'll go to the plane?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nListen, what do you say I sit in on this meeting for a few minutes.

When we say that are we comparing ourselves to\nthe Visigoths\nadjusted for inflation?\n\nJOSH\nCrime: \"Some crimes are so heinous, so hateful to American values that we\nought to lock\nprisoners up and throw away the key.\" Please don't say yes to that one.\n\nLEO\nKeep working on the plane.

Why\ndon't you\ncall me before?\n\nLEO\n[angrily] We stopped them with a warning shot from the USS Austin.\n\nJORDAN\nOkay.\n\nLEO\nAn LPD San Antonio class-warship. The weapons were not on their way to\nthe Qumari.\nThey were on their way to the Bahji. If I can't get everyone else on board\nwith the\nfact Qumar is our enemy surely we can agree that the international Bahji\ncell is.\nThe weapons were on their way to the Bahji. And the Austin stopped them.\n\nJORDAN\nQumar is leveraging the Mastico.\n\nLEO\nWe know this.\n\nJORDAN\nWhat do they want?\n\nLEO\nYesterday they want THAAD missile technology. Today they want convicted\nBahji operatives\nlet out of US jails. It changes.\n\nJORDAN\nYou're going to have to give them something.\n\nLEO\n[yelling] No! I don't have to do anything, Jordan. I'm right, they're\nwrong. They're\nstrong... I'm much stronger.\n\nLEO\nWhat happens tomorrow morning the President gets on TV and makes his case?\n\nJORDAN\nNo, we're not ready to do that. We're nowhere near ready.\n\nLEO\nWhat happens?\n\nJORDAN\nAssuming we get around the Boland amendment and any potential violations\nof domestic\nlaw and separation of powers--forgetting international outcry and sticking\nour Arab\nallies with an impossible choice of loyalties--six to five and pick 'em\nyou violated\nthe Geneva conventions.\n\nLEO\nSince when is it...?\n\nJORDAN\nSince Francisco Pizarro.\n\nLEO\nWell, if you're going to throw the Swiss in my face.\n\nJORDAN\n[sighs] Ali Nassir is at the general assembly.

Why don't you do it and we'll talk about the next step?\n\nLEO\nMargaret!\n\nJORDAN\nWhat was that before with ten words?\n\nLEO\nIt's a debating phrase. It has to do with making things simpler.

He grabs Donna's arm as she passes\nand pulls\nher into the corner.\n\nDONNA\nWhat's going on?\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay. As I understand it, it was the last debate of the first campaign.\n\nDONNA\nIs everything all right?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo. Moments before the debate started, the President went out to the alley\nto sneak\na cigarette, only he lit his necktie on fire.\n\nDONNA\nYes.\n\nCHARLIE\nAnd Josh gave him his, and he won and now it's his game tie. And it got\nripped at the\ncleaners by a cleaning solvent we probably shouldn't use anymore.\n\nDONNA\nDid you tell him?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo! But that's a different conversation. My point is [holds up a tie]\ndoesn't this\nlook an awful lot like the real one?\n\nDONNA\nI don't remember what the real one looked like, but where did you get a tie\non the\nplane?\n\nCHARLIE\nThe neck of the Deputy Labor Secretary but what the hell am I thinking? You\ncan't pull\noff this kind of fake out. Now it becomes the bad luck tie. Bad things will\nhappen in\nthat tie. No, you've got to face the music and dance alone.\n\nDONNA\nYou know what? I think maybe you and the President are obsessing on the\ntie. I'm going\nto throw this notion out on the stoop and see if the cat licks it up. I\nthink the\nPresident's performance in the debate had actually very little to do with\nthe tie.\n\nCHARLIE\nOkay.

You're the one I like.\n\nC.J.\nThank you very much. What happens is you'll be taken into the room and\na volunteer\nwill walk in behind you holding up a large sign with your name on it and\nthe press\nwill surround you.\n\nALBIE\nIs that dignified?\n\nC.J.\nAbsolutely not. Don't even hope. They're going to want you to talk about\nwhy is a\nRepublican spinning for the President. Nobody's expecting you to say a\nthing-not a\nthing-that would embarrass the party to which you've been a loyal and\nactive member\nyour entire life. He'll be attacked during the debate on China. He'll have\nto defend\nhis trade goals versus human rights violations.\n\nALBIE\nTrade is essential for human rights. Instead of isolating them we make them\nlive by\nthe same global trading rules as everyone else and gain 1.2 billion consumers\nfor our\nproducts and strengthen the forces of reform.\n\nC.J.\nThat's it. It's that simple.\n\nALBIE\nNo, it's not simple, it's incredibly complicated.\n\nC.J.\nSure.\n\nALBIE\nMcGarry's boy's over there coming up with greeting cards.\n\nC.J.\nJosh?\n\nALBIE\nHe's sitting with me, trying to boil down foreign policy into a ten-word\nstatement.\n\nC.J.\nNo, no, he's the ten-word. And believe me he hates it.\n\nALBIE\nI've been at the State Department for 30 years and there's no right answer\nfor these\nquestions and diplomacy needs all the words it can get its hands on. Plus,\nhe's from\nConnecticut.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, but the thing is Ritchie's good at it and we just need to show we have\nthat club\nin our bag. That's all.\n\nALBIE\nWhat kind of shot do you get with that club?\n\nC.J.\nAccording to the best people who've analyzed specific polling data there\nmay a million\nundecideds out there who'd come to Bartlet if he displayed one or two\nqualities that\nwere more like Ritchie. And we chose this. So for 90 seconds tonight the\nmountain will\ncome to Mohammed and we'll pretend the whole thing never happened.\n\nALBIE\nYeah, it's incredibly complicated.\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nALBIE\nThe answer I just gave you on trade?\n\nC.J.\nIt was perfect.\n\nALBIE\nYou know there's a decent chance I'm full of crap right?\n\nC.J.\nSure.\n\nALBIE\n\"Free trade is essential for human rights\" ... the end of that sentence is\n\"we hope\nbecause nothing else has worked.\"\n\nC.J.\nOkay, but I wouldn't say that tonight.\n\nALBIE\nThe President knows Chinese political prisoners are going to be sewing\nsoccer balls\nwith their teeth whether we sell them cheeseburgers or not, so let's sell them\ncheeseburgers.\n\nC.J.\nNor, if it were I, would I say that.\n\nALBIE\nLet me tell you something young lady, 3700 years ago in the Chang dynasty\nwhen a king\ndied, his slaves were beheaded-- the lucky ones. The unlucky one's were\nburied alive.\nPolitical repression? This is progress.\n\nC.J.\nStill, I think the first answer's our winner. So, can I find an attractive\naide and\nhave her bring you some Schweppe's Bitter Lemon?\n\nALBIE\nNo, I'm too steamed... yes, yes, okay.\n\nC.J.\nGood.

If it's Uncle Fluffy, we've got problems. If\nit's the\nPresident, in his last campaign, his last debate, for the last job he'll\never have...\nif the President shows up, I think it'll be a sight to see, I mean a sight\nto see.\nWhat do you think?\n\nTOBY\nI think you're going to enjoy yourself tonight.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT TWO\n* * *\n\nACT THREE\n\nFADE IN: INT.

His opponent\nwill then\nhave 60 seconds with which to ask a question and get an answer-- though it\nmust be\nlimited to the same topic. There will be two minutes for closing statements\nat the end.\nBy virtue of a coin toss, Governor Ritchie, the first question is for you.\n\nMAN\nGovernor Ritchie, good evening.\n\nGOVERNOR RITCHIE\nGood evening.\n\nMAN\nPerhaps the biggest philosophical difference between you and the President\nis over the\nrole of the federal government itself and whether national problems really\nhave national\nsolutions. Can you explain your view?\n\nRITCHIE\nWell, first, let me say good evening and thank you. It's a privilege to be\nhere. My view\nof this is simple--\n\nCUT TO: INT. SPIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nThe debate is being shown on large screens backstage. C.J. and Mark are\nhuddled around\na TV watching.\n\nRITCHIE\n[on TV] ...we don't need a Federal Department of Education telling us our\nchildren have\nto learn Esperanto, they have to learn Eskimo poetry.\n\nREPORTER MARK\nEskimo poetry?\n\nC.J.\nShh!\n\nRITCHIE\n[on TV] Let the states decide. Let the communities decide on health care,\non education,\non lower taxes, not higher taxes. Now, he's going to throw a big word at you--\n\"unfunded\nmandate.\" If Washington lets the states do it, it's an unfunded mandate. But\nwhat he\ndoesn't like is the federal government losing power. But I call it the\ningenuity of the\nAmerican people.\n\nMODERATOR\n[on TV] President Bartlet, you have 60 seconds for a question and an answer.\n\nBARTLET\n[on TV] Well, first of all, let's clear up a couple of things. \"Unfunded\nmandate\" is two\nwords, not one \"big word.\"\n\nThey cheer backstage.\n\nBARTLET\n[on TV] There are times when we're fifty states and there are times when\nwe're one\ncountry, and have national needs. And the way I know this is that Florida\ndidn't fight\nGermany in World War II or establish civil rights. You think states should\ndo the\ngoverning wall-to-wall. That's a perfectly valid opinion. But your state of\nFlorida got\n$12.6 billion in federal money last year-- from Nebraskans, and Virginians,\nand New\nYorkers, and Alaskans, with their Eskimo poetry. 12.6 out of a state budget\nof $50\nbillion, and I'm supposed to be using this time for a question, so here it\nis: Can we\nhave it back, please?\n\nJOSH\nGame on.\n\nC.J.\nOh, my God!\n\nSAM\nStrike 'em out, throw 'em out! [turns to reporters] Anybody want spin?\n\nC.J.\n[to Toby] It's not going to be Uncle Fluffy.\n\nTOBY\nNo.\n\nMODERATOR [VO]\nMr. President, the next question is for you.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\nThe debate continues.\n\nRITCHIE\n...and the partisan bickering. Now, I want people to work together in\nthis great\ncountry. And that's what I did in Florida -- I brought people together --\nand that's\nwhat I'll do as your President. End the logjam, end the gridlock, and bring\nRepublicans\ntogether with Democrats, 'cause Americans are tired of partisan politics.\n\nMODERATOR\nMr. President?\n\nBARTLET\nActually, what you've done in Florida is bring the right together with the\nfar right.\nAnd I don't think Americans are tired of partisan politics; I think they're\ntired of\nhearing career politicians diss partisan politics to get a gig. I've tried\nit before,\nthey ain't buying it. That's okay, though. That's okay, though, 'cause partisan\npolitics is good. Partisan politics is what the founders had in mind. It\nguarantees\nthat the minority opinion is heard, and as a lifelong possessor of minority\nopinions,\nI appreciate it. But if you're troubled by it, Governor, you should know,\nin this\ncampaign, you've used the word \"liberal\" seventy-four times in one day. It\nwas yesterday.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SPIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nTOBY\n[to Josh] I'm not sure I can watch anymore. No, wait, I can. I can.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nNISSIR\nIsreal launched and unwarranted, illegal, unilateral air attack against\nthe people\nof Qumar.\n\nLEO\nThe air strike was neither unwarranted nor was it against the people of\nQumar. It was\nagainst two Bahji terrorist camps after the Isreali Foreign Minster was shot\ndown by\nBahji operatives of, by-the-by, Qumair citizenship. Educated, if we're going\nto use\nthat word, in Qumari madrassahs and financed by fat members of the Qumari\nRoyal Family,\nincluding the Sultan's brother, Abdul ibn Shareef.\n\nNISSIR\nZionist propaganda. And we lost a cabinet minister as well.\n\nLEO\nYes, and you have the results of joint U.S, U.K., and Qumari search and rescue\noperations, that detail the tragic loss at sea. Yet your intelligence\nservices seem\nready to tell the world that it was Israel.\n\nNISSIR\nA state that sanctions covert assassination.\n\nLEO\nOf terrorists. Are you saying Mr. Shareef was one of them?\n\nJORDAN\nExcuse me, Mr. Ambassador. Leo?\n\nThey get up and walk into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.\n\nJORDAN\nYou got to stop it.\n\nLEO\nJordan, I...\n\nJORDAN\nYou, you got to turn the boat around. You're going to be at war.\n\nLEO\nI can't play games with these people anymore. I can't do it anymore. Ben\nYosef gave me\nthe medal of David, and ten hours later he was dead. I can't pretend Qumar's\nour quirky\nlittle ally whose culture it's important to be tolerant of. They're not\nwearing wooden\nshoes. I was a soldier. I flew fighters over the DMZ. It was incredibly\ndangerous. What\ndid I do that for? What am I handing to the next guy and to my kid?\n\nJORDAN\nTurn the boat around. Do that for the next guy, do that for Mallory and do\nthat for the\nPresident. He's busy right now.\n\nThey turn around to see the debate on TV.\n\nBARTLET\n[on TV] No, the question is: Should we focus on 90% of the kids, who go to\npublic school,\nor give parents money from the public-school budget to send their kids to\nprivate school\nat a time when private schools are even turning kids away who can afford\nit? Public\nschools are going to be the best schools in the country. They're gonna\nbe cathedrals.\nThe answer is a change in the way we finance schools!\n\nThey walk back into THE MURAL ROOM.\n\nNISSIR\nMr. McGarry, I think we are both men, and we both know there is a charade\nbeing enacted\nhere. I understand Western politics, and I understand President Bartlet is\nunable to\nadmit Israel's complicity in the death of the Sultan's brother during a\nclose election.\nSo perhaps we could...\n\nLeo laughs.\n\nNISSIR\nDid I say something funny?\n\nLEO\nYou think the President's afraid that if he admitted complicity in Shareef's\ndeath,\nhe would lose votes in this country? To sweep all fifty states, the President\nwould\nonly need to do two things-- blow the Sultan's brains out in Times Square,\nthen walk\nacross the street to Nathan's and buy a hot dog. Mr. Ambassador, you are\ngoing to turn\nthe Mastico around. You are going to cease and desist any disinformation\ncampaign that\nlinks the death of Shareef to Israel. And sometime next year, the Sultan is\ngoing to\npropose a Middle East peace plan -- the Qumar plan -- and win the Nobel\nPeace Prize.\nMake your phone call. I'll be waiting.\n\nLeo walks out of the room.\n\nNISSIR\nHe's a little hot under the collar, is he not?\n\nJORDAN\nExcuse me, I have a meeting of Godless infidels next door.\n\nCUT TO: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\nMODERATOR\nGovernor Ritchie, many economists have stated that the tax cut, which is\ncentrepiece\nof your economic agenda, could actually harm the economy. Is now really the\ntime to\ncut taxes?\n\nRITCHIE\nYou bet it is. We need to cut taxes for one reason-- the American people\nknow how to\nspend their money better than the federal government does.\n\nMODERATOR\nMr. President, your rebutal.\n\nBARTLET\nThere it is.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SPIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nREPORTER MARK\nWhat the hell?\n\nC.J.\nHe's got it.\n\nBARTLET\n[on TV] That's the ten-word answer my staff's been looking for for two\nweeks. There it\nis. Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip\nof the sword.\nHere's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes\nare too high?\nSo are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me\nten after\nthat, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every\nonce in a\nwhile, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those\ndays almost\nalways include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced\nmoments\nin leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of\nthe United\nStates, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way,\nif the left\nhas a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else.\n\nC.J.\n[to Toby, Josh, Donna, Sam, Carol and Andy.] I'm going to make a bold\nsuggestion, but\nhear me out. Let's not spin. Let's leave the room. We'll use the experts,\nbut nobody\nfrom the campaign, nobody from the White House, and definitely not us.\n\nJOSH\nWhy?\n\nC.J.\nThere's nothing left to do here, and it's inelegant. It's the punch Ali\nnever gave\nForeman when he was going down.\n\nTOBY\nAbsolutely.\n\nJOSH\nAll right, just a statement. The President's on his way to Washington to\nget back to\nwork.\n\nSAM\nAnd there'll be a lot of drinking on the plane. I don't think that should\nbe included\nin the statement.\n\nC.J.\nNo. Good heads-up.\n\nThey all break up and Albie Duncan walks into the Spin Room. The reporters\nstart\nshouting for him.\n\nALBIE\nTrade with China is essential for human rights. By engaging China and making\nthem by\nthe same global trading rules as everyone else, we gain 1.2 billion consumers\nfor our\nproducts, and we strengthen the forces of freedom, and the President knows\nthis.\n\nC.J.\nMr. Secretary?\n\nALBIE\nUh, I'm sorry, Miss Cregg, do you need me?\n\nC.J.\nI have a question. Isn't there a decent chance you and the President are wrong?\n\nALBIE\nI'm sorry?\n\nC.J.\nI mean, doesn't he also know that Chinese political dissidents are going to\nbe sewing\nsoccer balls together with their teeth whether or we sell them cheeseburgers\nor not?\nI mention this because the President just reminded us that complexity isn't\na vice.\n\nShe walks over to him and whispers in his ear.\n\nC.J.\nYou're the one I like, too.\n\nShe kisses him on the cheek then walks away.\n\nMODERATOR [VO]\nThat concludes this debate. Thank you very much and good night.\n\nCUT TO: INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS\nRitchie and Bartlet walk over and shake hands. Ritchie whispers in his ear.\n\nRITCHIE\nIt's over.\n\nBARTLET\nYou'll be back.\n\nRitchie and Bartlet walk back over to their sides of the stage where the\nfamily is\nwaiting to give them hugs.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BAR - NIGHT\n\n\tLAGUNA BEACH AROUND 1:00 A.M.\n\nWill is sitting at the bar, and Sam walks in.\n\nSAM\nHey.\n\nWILL\nTammy, I'd like to buy this old guy a beer. He had a good night.\n\nTAMMY\nOkay.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nWILL\nHow does it feel?\n\nSAM\nWinning?\n\nWILL\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nGood.\n\nWILL\nI thought he was going to have to fall all over himself trying to be genial.\n\nSAM\nSo did we. But then, we were convinced by polling that said he was going to\nbe seen\nas arrogant no matter what performance he gave in the debate. And then,\nthat morning\nat 3:10, my phone rings, and it's Toby Ziegler. He says, \"Don't you get\nit? It's a gift\nthat they're irreversibly convinced that he's arrogant 'cause now he can\nbe.\" If your\nguy's seen that way, you might as well knock some bodies down with it.\n\nWILL\nYou don't fly with the team?\n\nSAM\nNot this time. I had to return the rental car; that's why I was glad to\nget together\nagain. One-way charges on rental cars are insane. I think if everybody drove\none way,\nit'd all work out in the wash. What do you think?\n\nWILL\nI think every rental car in America would be at the Grand Canyon and the\nTropicana.\n\nSAM\nLet the campaign fold, man. Stay out of the news his week.\n\nWILL\nI'm sorry.\n\nTammy places Sam's drink in front of him.\n\nSAM\nThank you.\n\nTAMMY\nSure.\n\nSAM\nYou grew up in California politics?\n\nWILL\nNo, I grew up in Brussels.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nWILL\nSeveral members of my family worked at the NATO headquarters.\n\nSAM\nYou're not Thomas Bailey's grandson by any chance, are you?\n\nWILL\nI'm his son. I'm the youngest.\n\nSAM\nHmm. That had to have been a nice Career Day. \"Hello, I'm Will's dad. I'm\nSupreme\nCommander, NATO Allied Forces.\" Not a lot of kids took your lunch money, right?\n\nWILL\nNo.\n\nSAM\nIt's embarrassing, Will.\n\nWILL\nThere's a campaign being waged here, and I'm not embarrassed by it. There\nare things\nbeing talked about -- things you believe in, things the White House believes\nin --\nand they're only gonna be talked about in a blowout, and you know it. And\nyou know\nthere's no glory in it, and you still come here twice and tell me my guy's\na joke.\nThat my people are embarrassing. How many Democrats told you to get out of\nthe way\nfor John Hoynes? The bandwagon was in Texas, and the boys were in Nashua,\nand how\nDemocrats told you it was embarrassing? I'm not kidding, Sam. How many?\n\nSAM\nAll of them.\n\nWILL\nThat's right.\n\nSAM\nYou're the one who wrote Tillman's speech.\n\nWILL\nNo, I'm not.\n\nSAM\nHis speech to the Standford Club-- yes, you are.\n\nWILL\nI don't even... I don't know what you're...\n\nSAM\nThat's fine. But you and I both know different, right? So let's have some\nrespect for\nthat.\n\nWILL\nYou've ghosted for senators, movie stars, I think the King of Belgium one\ntime. Do you\nsay anything?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nWILL\nWhy?\n\nSAM\nSpeechwriters don't do that.\n\nWILL\nYeah.\n\nSAM\nOkay, I'll just say that it was very good, and a number of people think so,\nand leave\nit there. Except to say that the jokes worked, too. I don't know who wrote\nthem, maybe\nthe King of Belgium, but I know it wasn't the Governor of California.\n\nWILL\n[pointing to Elsie] You see that girl over there?\n\nSAM\nThat's the one I thought was your assistant.\n\nWILL\nHer name is Elsie Snuffin.\n\nSAM\nWhat a great name.\n\nWILL\nIsn't it?\n\nSAM\nWhy'd you tell me that?\n\nWILL\nShe wrote the jokes. Anyway, you should know about her.\n\nSAM\nWhere'd you find her?\n\nWILL\nShe was the 11th man on a ten-man writing staff for a sitcom. They weren't\nusing her\nstuff 'cause it was smarter than the show, but she didn't know that.\n\nSAM\nAll right. Thank you for the beer and for the lively conversation. Listen.. if\nyou\ncan't find a Democrat, tells Mrs. Wilde... tell Kay that I'll do it.\n\nWILL\nAre you kidding?\n\nSAM\nTell her I'm a magna cum laude graduate of Princeton and editor of the Duke\nLaw Review.\nTell her I've worked for Congressmen and the DCCC. I have seven years at\nGage Whitney,\nand for the last four I've served as Deputy Communications Director and\nSenior Counsel.\nTell her I grew up two streets from here.\n\nWILL\nI'm not going to ask anyone else.\n\nSAM\nThis is for election night, if you win. If I read about it before that,\nI'm gonna deny\nit and we're through.\n\nSam walks over to where other staffers of Horton Wildes campaign are seated.\n\nSAM\nExcuse me.\n\nThey applaud and cheer.\n\nSAM\nListen.\n\nGIRL\nWe love you!\n\nSAM\nThank you. Listen, I've got to get to a bed, but I just wanted to say,\nthanks for the\nhard work. One more week. You're making a lot of people proud. And if you\nget a chance,\nread the text of the Governor's speech to the Stanford Club. It's going to\ngive you\nchills. And the jokes, I think, are particularly funny. Anyway... good luck.\n\nThey stand up and cheer. He looks at Elsie who mouths \"Thank you\" to him. He\nbegins\nto walk out.\n\nSAM\nGood night, Will.\n\nWILL\nDon't forget your necktie.\n\nSAM\nKeep it.\n\nSam walks out of the bar.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John Wells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.

The email, which is exactly this long, by the way-- in case as a\nboy you had some\nsort of frightening experience with Balzac and that's why you didn't read it--\nsays, at the\ntop, \"This applies only to the daily Senior Staff meeting.\" One meeting it's\ngoing to be\nimportant to be one time.\n\nJOSH\nWell, I think that's a random cracking of the whip.\n\nDEBBIE\nAccording to the last 300 daily dairies, the President is typically 70 to\n90 minutes over-scheduled\nby the end of the day. The median time a day ends, the over/under 10:20\np.m. As many days have ended\nafter that time as have ended before it. The result being the Commander in\nChief of the U.S. Armed\nForces hasn't had a night's sleep in four years. That's both bad and easy\nto fix.\n\nJOSH\nOkay. Well, yes that's hard to argue against and I'll remember this talk\nthe next time.\n\nDEBBIE\nI have all the confidence in the world that you will.\n\nJOSH\nOkay, well, I'm going in now, all right?\n\nDEBBIE\nSweet of you to tell me a joke, Josh.

I'm going to find someone\nwho will swap votes.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry?\n\nDONNA\nI'm going to find a Ritchie supporter who'll vote for the President to offset\nmy absentee ballot.\n\nJOSH\nReally?\n\nDONNA\nIt's Election Day. There's nothing to do. I'm doing this.\n\nJOSH\nAnd you think it's going to take about 20 minutes?\n\nDONNA\nYeah, I'll be right back. [walks off]\n\nJOSH\nYou bet.

NORTHWEST LOBBY - NIGHT\n\nJULIE (REPORTER ON TV)\n...and we still have-- I want to remind our viewers-- we still have three\nHouse races\nundecided as we've been reporting. Those would be Tennessee second, New York\n22nd and\nthe race that's been dubbed Lazarus 47 in some circles, the race for\nCalifornia's 47th\nCongressional District between the six-term incumbent Republican Chuck Webb\nand Democrat\nHorton Wilde who passed away some three weeks ago, but whose name remains\non the ballot.\nGeorge, which is stranger? That a Democrat is competitive in Orange County\nor that the\nDemocrat in question is...? I don't mean to make light of this of course,\nbut the\ncandidate passed away.\n\nGEORGE (on TV)\nThey're both pretty strange Julie, but for a Democrat to win the 47th,\nhe's going to\nhave to have something going for him, and this was it.\n\nJULIE (on TV)\nMartin, how important were the candidate's performances in the debate?\n\nMARTIN (on TV)\nWell, I'll tell you how important. On the day before the debate, the President\nheld a\nthree-point lead in most polls and that's within the margin of error--\na statistical tie.\nAmong those who said they were undecided, 73% said they made up there minds\nbased on the\ndebates and 69% of that population went for the President. And that's how...\n\nMARTIN (on TV)\nThat's how the President won.\n\nJULIE (on TV)\nWhat is Governor Ritchie thinking...?\n\nCUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nSAM\nHe said... what he said was this-- he said, \"A probable impossibility is\npreferable to an\nimprobable possibility.\" The impossible is preferable to the improbable. What\ndid he mean?\nHe meant that it's okay to have a broomstick sing and dance, but you shouldn't\nturn on the\nradio and hear the news report you need to hear.\n\nDONNA\nWant some cake?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nDONNA\nYou sure?\n\nSAM\nWhat kind?\n\nDONNA\nCake.\n\nSAM\nThey have flavors.\n\nDONNA\nI don't know.\n\nSAM\nIt was a confluence of events that I'm saying, if you pitched it to a\nHollywood movie producer,\nthey'd tell you that Aristotle says, a probable impossibility is preferable\nto an improbable\npossibility.\n\nDONNA\nIt doesn't quite sound like them.\n\nSAM\nThe Midwest, the RNC exits, a dead candidate, a rainstorm...? It's Aristotle\nall over the place.\n\nDONNA\nI'm going to turn these off. Why don't you head out into the party? Everyone's\nasking for you.\n\nSAM\nYou really don't know what kind...?\n\nDONNA\nIt's cake! It's cake.\n\nSAM\nI talked to the woman. She had tears in her voice. Her husband loved the\nPresident, admired\nhis integrity. Yes, we're big on integrity. By the way, when I said I'd run\nin his place,\nit's not like I meant it.\n\nDONNA\n[takes his hand] Let's go to the party. There are televisions\neverywhere.

Got to get him.\n\nGAIL (on TV)\nNo, there isn't. Not yet. But I can report a rumor that's been making its\nway around...\n\nSAM\nOf course you can. Why not?\n\nGAIL (on TV)\n...the former Orange County resident and current White House Senior Advisor\nSam Seaborn\nwill seek the seat.\n\nIt goes absolutely quiet in the Bullpen.\n\nBERNIE (on TV)\nAnd the plot thickens.\n\nJULIE (on TV)\nSam Seaborn, of course, an architect of the President's first victory as\nwell as his--\nI think we have to start calling it a landslide-- tonight.\n\nSAM\nThey're talking about someone else.\n\nJULIE (on TV)\nI'm told that we've got a picture we're going to throw up on the screen.\n\nBERNIE (on TV)\nJulie, I have to interrupt.

These people make me crazy. \"He-he didn't do\nenough down-ticket\ncampaigning.\" You have any idea how much gumbo that man ate?\n\nAMY\nThis is what you do, you bounce off the subject.\n\nA waiter comes walking by with a platter of shrimp.\n\nAMY\nOh, shrimp.\n\nC.J.\nI don't think running for Congress is the thing you do to change the story.\n\nJOSH\nI know, but there are real reasons.

I deserve to lose.\n\nAMY\nAnd you took a hit, ironically on a Wisconsin referendum to legalize\ngambling. But you did\nwin four Omaha steaks on the over-under in the Texas Farm Commissioners race.\n\nJOSH\nDoes the U.S. Attorney's Office know about you?\n\nAMY\nYeah, they have me on file.\n\nJOSH\nCan we talk to you for a minute?\n\nTOBY\nActually, I'm going to, uh, talk to the President and First Lady.

He's the Deputy Chief of Staff. I\nnoticed that the\nroom was cold before so I loosened up the radiator, but... Then, well,\nI guess you can say\nI broke it. But it's fine now. It should be fine.

It breaks\ninto three\nlarge chunks.\n\nDONNA\nWhat was that?\n\nJACK\nA $400 ashtray. It's off the U.S.S. Greenville, a nuclear attack submarine\nand a likely\ntarget for a torpedo. When you get hit with one, you've got enough problems\nwithout glass\nflying into the eyes of the navigator and the Officer of the Deck. This\none's built to\nbreak into three dull pieces. We lead a slightly different life out there\nand it costs a\nlittle more money.\n\nDONNA\nI can't believe you broke a $400 ashtray.\n\nJACK\nYeah, I wish I hadn't done that. It's...

That's what\nthis election\nis about. We went in the field, we came up with the middle class tax cut\nthat made sense,\nplus, the 100% tax deductible tuition...\n\nC.J.\nExcuse me. Chris Whitaker, right?\n\nWHITAKER\nYeah, yeah.\n\nC.J.\nThank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nWHITAKER\nWell, thank you.\n\nC.J.\nNo, please. We're all impressed with how influential you were, particularly\nwhen you consider\nthat most of us have never met you. But what I'm most grateful for is the\nprocess story,\nwhich takes attention from the debate, and focuses it where it belongs,\nwhich is the contest.\nThis is the story everyone'll be clamouring for and I like that you're\nfilling that need.\nAnd to show my gratitude, I'm calling all the major news outlets and letting\nthem know that\nI'll be forwarding all your confidential memos to the President, logs of\nall your calls with\nhim, Secret Service logs of your meetings inside the White House.\n\nWHITAKER\nI really pissed you off, huh?\n\nC.J.\nDon't disrespect Leo McGarry and Bruno Gianelli.\n\nC.J. walks away into the HALLWAY where she spots Sam.\n\nC.J.\nSam.\n\nSAM\nI was just on my way.

Why would you think something like that?\n\nC.J.\nWell, it was Josh's idea.\n\nJOSH\nActually, it was Amy's.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nAMY\nWell, I picked a trifecta with the California 47th, the sheriffs race in\nArizona and the\nTulsa Family Court.\n\nSAM\nWell, can I just give you the money and not...\n\nAMY\nI also think you'd be a home run choice. You're going to raise a lot of\nmoney. I'm going to\nhelp you and I have a hunch the President, who just won a landslide, will\nbe making some\nvisits as well. You'll be the best funded Democrat ever run in 47. You're\nnot going to win,\nso you can't lose.\n\nJOSH\nI think you'd energize the state party. We're not going to let you look like\na fool.\nWe won't allow it.\n\nSAM\n(to Toby) What do you think?\n\nTOBY\nI don't think you should do it. Energizing the state party's good. A\nwell-funded airing of\nthe issues is good. So is mollifying House Democrats, but you have to ask\nyourself, is it\nworth it? You're going to lose. A Democrat's always loses in the 47th. Can't\njust pick up\nand try someplace else. They have a name for that.\n\nSAM\nI don't know. I don't know. I worked in a State Asembly race in Manhattan\nin a district\nwhere Democrats outnumbered Republicans 16 to 1. But everywhere we went,\nthere'd be one\nlone poster of a right-wing nutbar who wanted to to eliminate the income\ntax. And he was\nholding up signs and canvassing everywhere and bugging the local reporters\nuntil we had to\ncomment on it. So I introduced myself to his campaign manager, and I said,\n\"What are you\ndoing? Your candidate doesn't have a chance and neither do your issues.\" He\nsaid, \"This is\nwhat I believe. And no candidate gets to run in my district without speaking\nto my issue.\"\nI came this close to voting for him. So... I don't know about what you\njust said.\n\nTOBY\nThen I think you should win.\n\nThere's a knock on the door. Bonnie enters.\n\nBONNIE\nI'm sorry. I finally got Mrs. Wilde on the phone.\n\nSAM\nAll right.\n\nC.J.\n\"All right,\" what?\n\nSAM\nAll right. And get me Will Bailey on the phone, too.

Which is what it is, Lulu.\n\nDONNA\nWho the hell is Lulu?\n\nJOSH\n[as he walks off] It's To Sir With Love.\n\nDONNA\nThank you.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY\nAbbey and her aide are inside.\n\nABBEY\nI'm just gonna need the lists.\n\nBOBBY\nI have the lists.\n\nABBEY\nI know, that's why I'm asking you for them.\n\nBOBBY\nDid you want them?\n\nABBEY\nYes...\n\nBOBBY\nI'm sorry, we're talking about the lists?\n\nABBEY\nAnd your having them and my wanting them.\n\nBOBBY\nYes, Ma'am.\n\nBartlet stops at the door as Bobby exits.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Terry.\n\nBOBBY\nBobby, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nBartlet enters and closes the door.\n\nABBEY\nYou pulled me out of the Womens' Caucus.\n\nBARTLET\nNo need to thank me. Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?\n\nABBEY\nShe moved to Miami and took up massage.\n\nBARTLET\nReally?\n\nABBEY\nLast I heard.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat they hell are you talking about?\n\nABBEY\nYou're the one who asked me...\n\nBARTLET\nWasn't Mrs. Wilberforce our cat?\n\nABBEY\nShe was our housekeeper.\n\nBARTLET\nReally? All right. Eisenmenger's Syndrome.\n\nABBEY\nIt's a cyanotic heart condition. There's something called ventricular-\nseptal defect...\n\nBARTLET\nThe Ayatollah's son has it.\n\nABBEY\nAm I dreaming, or are you talking to me about foreign policy? You're not\nworried the\nsky's gonna fall down?\n\nBARTLET\nNo, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.\n\nABBEY\nWhat's the problem, Jed? Don't tell me there's a problem with State...\n\nBARTLET\nThe only doctor available won't do it.\n\nABBEY\nHe's Jewish?\n\nBARTLET\nPersian.\n\nABBEY\nHe doesn't have a choice.\n\nBARTLET\nAbbey...\n\nABBEY\nHe doesn't. Doctors aren't instruments of the state, and they're not allowed\nto choose\npatients on spec.\n\nBARTLET\nI can't order him to do it.\n\nABBEY\nYes, you can.\n\nBARTLET\nThrough the power vested in me by you?\n\nABBEY\nSamuel Mudd set Booth's leg after he shot Lincoln. Doctors are liable in\nthis country\nif they don't treat the patient right in front of them.\n\nBARTLET\nJust for the record, this is why we don't talk about foreign policy. Which\nwe do, and\nyou don't think we do it enough.\n\nABBEY\nWhy?\n\nBARTLET\nBecause Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for setting that leg.\n\nABBEY\nSo?\n\nBARTLET\nWhat 'so'?\n\nABBEY\nSo that's the way it goes. You set the leg.\n\nBARTLET\nThe patient right in front of them?\n\nABBEY\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. Go back to the sewing thing.\n\nABBEY\nIt's the Women's... nevermind.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HOYNES' OFFICE - DAY\nThe Vice President leads Josh inside.\n\nHOYNES\nI couldn't tell you the last time I took a whole week away, Josh. You ought\nto take a\nvacation yourself.\n\nJOSH\nYeah, I don't get Hawaii. Great weather, great beaches, universal health\ncare... I'm\nwaiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nHOYNES\nYou remember Neil Spencer, the Rep from Honolulu who helped us on the ag bill?\n\nJOSH\nSure.\n\nHOYNES\nHe spent all his time tanning on the Capitol balcony.\n\nJOSH\nBecause if he went home without a tan...\n\nHOYNES\nThey'd know he'd gone to Washington.\n\nJOSH\nWe got to talk politics.\n\nHOYNES\nI'd like to. I'm glad we had that little talk on Air Force Two. I think from\ntime to\ntime...\n\nJOSH\nWe need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.\n\nHOYNES\nExcuse me?\n\nJOSH\nWe're days after an election, we've got to govern. It's too early...\n\nHOYNES\nIs that what this is all about?\n\nJOSH\nTriplehorn alone can tie us in knots.\n\nHOYNES\nWell, good for Triplehorn. I've got an obligation to myself here.\n\nJOSH\nYou've got a Constitutional obligation, that comes first.\n\nHOYNES\nLast time I checked, my Constitutional obligation was to have a pulse.\n\nJOSH\nWe need these two years. It's our last chance to govern, John...\n\nHOYNES\nMr. Vice President.\n\nJOSH\nThere are going to be lots of ways...\n\nHOYNES\nNo zealot like a convert, Josh.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nHOYNES\nIt means you'd have been great at Leo's job.\n\nJOSH\nHalf this town's going to be runnung. I do the President's politics. He\ncan't govern\nif I'm seen as...\n\nHOYNES\nBeing for me? I don't think there's much risk of that.\n\nHe opens the door for Josh to exit.\n\nHOYNES\nYou were wrong. I never went to Hawaii.\n\nJOSH\nWhat?\n\nHOYNES\nWe skipped Hawaii. We went rafting on the Flathead River instead.\n\nFADE OUT.\nEND ACT THREE\n* * *\n\nACT FOUR\n\nFADE IN: INT.

Don't touch that. Or that.\n\nBartlet enters, and Debbie hands him a note.\n\nBARTLET\n\"The boy's on the plane. He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension.\" That's\nelevated\npressure in the lungs, I think. That could lead to what? Doctor, that could\nlead to what?\n\nDR. ESSAN MOHEBI\nI'm sorry, I...\n\nBARTLET\nThat cold lead to what?\n\nMOHEBI\nSudden heart failure.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's what it says here. Follow me.\n\nBartlet goes in THE OVAL OFFICE. Dr. Mohebi glances at Debbie before\nfollowing him.\n\nBARTLET [cont]\nHis right ventricular pressure has risen to 102 mm Mercury.\n\nMOHEBI\nLow-oxygen blood's beginning to bypass the lungs.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's right, and he has something called in situ thrombi.\n\nMOHEBI\nHis arteries have lost their coagulant properties and Mr. President, I\nresent this.\n\nBARTLET\nDr. Mohebi, I don't care. Why aren't you scrubbing up?\n\nMOHEBI\nPeople are taken from their homes in the dead of night, and jailed and\ntortured for\nmonths at a time.\n\nBARTLET\nI know.\n\nMOHEBI\nPublic executions...\n\nBARTLET\nDoctor...\n\nMOHEBI\nPolitical opponents dragged outside state borders...\n\nBARTLET\nI know this. Don't you think I know?\n\nMOHEBI\nI won't aid the enemy.\n\nBARTLET\nI'll let you know who the enemy is. That's my job. It's not a 15-year-old boy.\n\nMOHEBI\nHow do I know these organs were donated voluntarily?\n\nBARTLET\nDoctors Without Borders.\n\nMOHEBI\nYou don't know these people, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nI do know these people. You're crazy if you don't think I do.\n\nMOHEBI\nAnd I don't need to be told who the enemy is.\n\nBARTLET\nDoctor...\n\nMOHEBI\nIt's not your family that's still there. My family's there. If the procedure\nisn't\nsuccessful...\n\nBARTLET\nNothing will happen to them.\n\nMOHEBI\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\nNothing will happen to them.\n\nMOHEBI\nWho's making that guarantee?\n\nBARTLET\nWell, the Swiss, I guess. Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect\nyou and\nyour family, of course I will. Can I just say that this is how things change\nfor the\nbetter? A world-class surgeon or a schoolteacher in Afjah who questions\nthe ayatollah's\ndivine power. Do me a favor, Doctor, go back to Smith-Lansing and look at\nthe kid,\n'cause I think when you do, you're going to scrub up. If you don't, I\nrespect that,\nand the man made his own bed. Okay?\n\nMOHEBI\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat was your father's name?\n\nMOHEBI\nRaji.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat'd he teach?\n\nMOHEBI\nScience.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you. Get him to Baltimore.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY\nJosh is sitting across Leo.\n\nLEO\nYou think cell phones, maybe?\n\nJOSH\nNot whitewater rafting. And staff can't make those calls. They're top-tier\nIowa people,\nand New Hampshire. Forty, fifty calls from the Flathead River?\n\nLEO\nThat really doesn't seem possible. Unless...\n\nJOSH\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\nLEO\nAll right.

We'll find something. I don't know what.\n\nKAREN\nYou don't have to do that.\n\nTOBY\nCan't be Museum Studies. God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.\n\nKAREN\nI've made a lot of enemies on the Hill. You don't owe me.\n\nTOBY\nWe asked you to fight a losing... Yes, we owe you.\n\nKAREN\nThis is... when the President calls a play...\n\nTOBY\nI called the play. I called it.\n\nKAREN\nRasing the gas tax.\n\nTOBY\nIt was a loser and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.\n\nKAREN\nThat doesn't make any difference.\n\nTOBY\nWell, look, let's just...\n\nKAREN\nI came out for a gas tax 'cause someone from Michigan had to. Gas prices\nare too low.\nIt's why the air is polluted. It's why no one wants alternative fuels.\n\nTOBY\nAnd, clearly, that argument took the nation by storm.\n\nKAREN\nIn my religion... the whole symbol of the religion ended in crucifixion\nand condemnation.\nThat wasn't the measure of the experience. It's just the way it ended.\n\nTOBY\nYeah, but I'm the Romans.\n\nKAREN\nIt's in the living. It's in the campaigning that you make your mark. Sometimes\nyou win,\nand sometimes you lose. You have until the end of the day on the tickets,\nby the way.\n\nCUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - NIGHT\nSam enters the building and Bonnie walks up to greet him.

Everyone's on the ballot.\n\nBARTLET\nIs there another Democrat?\n\nSAM\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're the nominee.\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd I know how you feel. You like Scott Holcomb?\n\nSAM\nI don't know him well.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's terrific.\n\nSAM\nThere's a good guy out there named Will Bailey if he should come across\nyour radar.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're going to campaign on prescription drugs?\n\nSAM\nOur prescription drug bill-- yes, sir-- and our Medicare reforms and the\nBartlet\nEnergy Plan.\n\nBARTLET\nSam.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nIt's okay to run away from me when you need to.\n\nSAM\nI would never, Mr. President. I simply would never do that. That's not how\nI'm getting\nvotes.\n\nBARTLET\nI appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about. You disagreed with\nme on\nMedicare. I remember the meeting right here. Then you wrote a five-page\nmemo. Run\ntowards yourself. I'm wrong about that. Walk. You're not going to be used\nto your\nsurroundings.\n\nSAM\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nYou lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll kill you.

I can't help it if...\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nThey'll thank whatever they want.\n\nLEO\nWell, they think you're freezing the race for Hoynes.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm freezing it for us. We just won four more years. It's not time for\na free-for-all.\n\nLEO\nThis shouldn't be what you do anymore.\n\nBARTLET\nDo I call them all back?\n\nLEO\nWe'll take care of it.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right.\n\nLEO\nTehran's going to accelerate medium-range missile tests by two weeks.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nWe'll gather the NSC principles in the morning.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right.

I am a character in this story?\n\nThey walk inside THE WEST WING.\n\nC.J.\nWell, I suppose that's up to you. A navy pilot, lieutenant commander Vickie\nHilton\nhas been taken under arrest by the military police as being charged by\nthe judge\nadvocate with having an affair with a married officer, an inferior,\na lieutenant-jg.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't see being a character.\n\nC.J.\nWell, heads up anyway.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you.\n\nC.J. walks off. Leo meets Bartlet, and they walk.\n\nLEO\nGood morning, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHey.\n\nLEO\nHow'd it go?\n\nBARTLET\nCould have gone better. I didn't think adultery was against the uniform code.\n\nLEO\nYou're talking about Vickie Hilton?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. It's against military law?\n\nLEO\nNo. They don't like fraternization, but her thing isn't the affair, it's\nfailure\nto follow an order.\n\nBARTLET\nThey told her to stop?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat can she get?\n\nLEO\nShe could go to jail for two years.\n\nBARTLET\nFor failure to follow an order?\n\nLEO\nSure.\n\nBARTLET\nWe shold have that here.\n\nBartlet walks into the CABINET MEETING ROOM where the members of his\nCabinet are\nwaiting for him.

I don't know if this is true, but a Presidential\nhistorian\ntold me that this was the most stable cabinet since Hoover's. Which is nice,\nbut you\ngot to think, how many other jobs were really available? But here are\nfacts. You\ncreated over nine million new jobs, and the highest home-ownership rate\non record.\nMore than 150 new trade agreements. You created the largest expansion of\ncollege aid\nsince the GI Bill. Cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. And you did it\nall while\neliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations. Not bad for government\nwork. Thank you.\n\nBartlet leaves the room, and Leo motions Carol to show a reporter and\ncameraman out.\nLeo and the cabinet take their seats.\n\nLEO\nI'll add my thanks, and I'll need your letters of resignation by 7:00.\n\nSMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.\nEND TEASER\n* * *\n\nACT ONE\n\nFADE IN: INT.

John.\n\nREPORTER JOHN\nCan you give us a preview of the Presidents address at APEC?\n\nC.J.\nI can tell you that he's been working out some new material and that it\nhas absolutely\nbeen destroying on the campuses. Of course, Showtime will have their cameras\nat APEC\nto record the whole thing for the President's one-hour special called Bartlet:\nIn the\nThick of It.\n\nREPORTER JOHN\nSo, no.\n\nC.J.\nNo. I'll finish with a little housekeeping for those who don't know. In\na two-term\nPresidency, as a matter of courtesy, the President's cabinet resigns\nwithout being\nasked, giving the President the option of hiring them or not, rather than\nfiring\nthem or not. Those resignations will be submitted today. That's all. Thanks.\n\nC.J. steps down from the podium as MITCH approaches.\n\nREPORTER MITCH\nC.J.?\n\nC.J.\nYeah.\n\nMITCH\nCan we talk?\n\nC.J.\nSure.

Listen, there is no way I'm going to be\nable to\nhelp with this, which is worse for me then it is for you, but there's never\ngoing to\nbe the time.\n\nTOBY\nWasn't counting on it.\n\nSAM\nAre you going to use Michael?\n\nTOBY\nFrom the staff?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nMichael's who you use when you need brief remarks to whoever wrote the check we\ncouldn't turn down.\n\nSAM\nWhat about Jerry?\n\nTOBY\nJerry's who you use when you can't get Michael. there's no one on the\nspeech writing\nstaff who could do this. It's okay.\n\nSAM\nThat's a pretty big job to do by yourself.\n\nTOBY\nYou're going to remember the local AFL?\n\nSAM\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nYou got to go door-to-door.\n\nSAM\nI know.\n\nTOBY\nYou were 18 when you lived there.\n\nSAM\nYou want a hug?\n\nTOBY\nPut the banner back.

I guess also, the thing is she isn't just any pilot. She's\nlike Jackie\nRobinson. She's busted a lot of barriers. She's the first woman at Miramar,\nfirst\nwoman to fly the F-14 Tomcat, she teaches on an F-14.

I... I\ndon't know.\nI certainly wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that she was... you\nknow...\nAnyway, if you wanted to ask her out, she'd probably say yes.\n\nJACK\nHey, Josh, uh... I'm new and I want to do well and, uh, I don't want to get\nin between\nanything.\n\nJOSH\n\"In between anything\"?\n\nJACK\nI have an aide, who in my life, I haven't talked about as much as you've talked\nabout Donna in our entire relationship, yours and mine, which is a cummulative\ntotal of seven minutes old.\n\nJOSH\nNo, no, no.\n\nJACK\nYou sure?\n\nJOSH\nSure. Tell me your aide's name. I'll ask her out. We'll double.\n\nJACK\nChief Petty Officer Harold Wendell.\n\nJOSH\nI got the fuzzy end of that lolipop.\n\nJACK\nI don't know. Wendell's not \"cute\" cute but he's so funny.\n\nJOSH\nSo, that's it. We're done talking about Donna. Whose full name is Donnatella,\nby\nthe way. Mom's Italian... Dad's Irish. Okay. Thanks.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY\nCharlie and Bartlet are standing at the desk. Bartlet is signing papers.\n\nBARTLET\nHe's wrong. Leo's wrong. Are we to live with the assumption that there are\nno men\nin the services who've commited adultery? I don't know what's worse:\nbeing stupid\nor pretending to be stupid. Tell him that.\n\nCHARLIE\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nNo, I'm going to do it.\n\nBartlet storms into LEO'S OFFICE where he disrupts a meeting.\n\nBARTLET\nEisenhower and Kay Summersby, a subordinate. Hammond with the wives of\ntwo junior\nofficers. So, G.I. Jane gets a court-martial? G.I. Joe gets a short film\non hygeine?\nThat is all I have to say to you. [points]\n\nBartlet walks back to his desk in THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nCHARLIE\nFeel better, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nI forgot to tell him something else.\n\nBartlet begins to walk to Leo's office, but Leo comes into the Oval Office\ncarrying\na book.\n\nLEO\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 134 which exist to ensure\nthat soldiers\nwill risk their lives for each other. I think you'll agree that, without\nthat there\nisn't much point in having Articles 1 through 133. Nobody ordered Eisenhower\nto stop\nseeing Summersby.\n\nBARTLET\nThat's right. Because men don't give that order to other men.\n\nLEO\nExcuse me, but did you not fire our Ambassador to somewhere in South America--\nI can't\nremember-- 'cause he was messing around with...\n\nBARTLET\nThe daughter of the president of Brazil, which presented a politcal prblem\nfor me.\nAlso, I didn't fire him, I asked him to resign. And I set him up in the\nprivate sector.\nAnd if you think the differnce is semantics, look up dishonorable discharge\nin there.\nLook up Fort Leavenworth.\n\nNANCY\n[entering] Sir, it's the Secretary-General again.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, you can't take that, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI read the memo on Rwanda. Average rainfall nine inches. That's the memo\nToby wanted\nme to read?\n\nCHARLIE\nOn short notice? Yes, sir.\n\nLEO\nI told him to pass-block on the call.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nParking tickets.\n\nBartlet storms to his desk, to answer the phone.\n\nLEO\nNow please, don't leap into it. Don't...\n\nBartlet pushes the speaker button and starts yelling.\n\nBARTLET\n[screaming] There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get\ntowed! I hope\nthey get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft\nshow at Shea,\na flea market or a tractor show!\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, that was probably his secretary.\n\nBARTLET\nDamn it.\n\nCHARLIE\nYou can bet she'll be parking it in a garage, though.\n\nBARTLET\nDo you really think that Vicky Hilton is unable to distinguish between\nthis order\nand a combat order?\n\nLEO\nThis was combat order. They're all combat orders! When you order a guy to\ngo fight,\nthe guy can't think it's 'cause you're sleeping with his wife.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're right.\n\nLeo does a double take.\n\nLEO\nThat's... an unusual phrase for you, sir. Did you just learn it?\n\nBARTLET\nWell, you didn't let me finish.\n\nLEO\nI had a hunch.\n\nBARTLET\nI may also be right. We get five more people in here, I think we're going\nto have\neight opinions.\n\nLEO\nThat's right.\n\nBARTLET\nSo let's.\n\nLEO\nIt's Pentagon.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd two elections in a row, people said they wanted me to run that.\n\nLEO\nThere are issues of chain of command and command influence.\n\nBARTLET\nRight now, I'm not talking about overruling anyone or pardoning anyone. Right\nnow,\nI'm just talking about having people over and asking questions. I like\nbasketball,\nbut I can't play. I don't know why. I played in prep school and I liked\nbeing on\nthe team, but I didn't want the ball and the coach said, \"Jed, winners\nalways want\nthe ball.\" I said, \"Coach, winners are also better then I am.\" He said,\n\"Son, to\nbe a winner, you've got to think like a winner.\" I said, \"Coach, to be\na winner,\nyou've also got to be better than I am.\" Anyway, he was right. Winners want\nthe ball.\nI don't think I ever want to hear it's too sticky for the Oval Office. [at\nphone,\nyelling] Except for parking tickets you cheap-ass diplomats! [to Charlie]\nRead that\nwhole memo on Rwanda, by the way. [to Leo] What are you smiling at?\n\nLEO\nNothing.\n\nBARTLET\nAre we together on this? Do we have resolve? We've got four years, no election\nand a\nRepublican Congress that hates me and actually hates you more. You ready to\nsaddle up?\n\nLEO\nWell, I serve at the President's pleasure... and it's kind of nice for me to.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right. Good then. Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nCUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT\nDonna's at her desk when Josh walks out of his office.\n\nJOSH\nHey. I think he's going to call you.\n\nDONNA\nHe already did. Thank you, thank you. He asked me to have a drink tonight\nand I'd\nreally love to go home and shower and change. [putting on her coat and scarf]\nThe two\nCBO reports are right on your desk, as is the East Asia paper. Your call\nsheet is clear.\nIf there's anything else, I'm happy to come in early tomorrow. Do you think\nI could go?\n\nJOSH\nWhat time is it?\n\nDONNA\nQuarter to eight.\n\nJOSH\nSure.\n\nDONNA\nThanks. I really like him.\n\nJOSH\nHave a good time. Those are good stories about you, though. Those stories\nwould make\nme like you.\n\nDONNA\nYou like everybody.\n\nJOSH\nTomorrow's Thanksgiving.\n\nDONNA\nYeah.\n\nJOSH\nI meant, you won't be coming in early tomorrow. You won't be coming in at all.\n\nDONNA\nIs there anything you need?\n\nJOSH\nNo, I'm just saying...\n\nDONNA\nOkay. Happy Thanksgiving!\n\nJOSH\nYou too.\n\nDonna leaves and Josh watches her as she departs. He begins to walk through his\nbullpen when Janice speaks to him from her desk.\n\nJANICE\nI'm not obsessed, you know.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry?\n\nJANICE\nI'm not obsessed. I'm just a fan, and I care.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's your name again?\n\nJANICE\nJanice.\n\nJOSH\nI'm a fan. I'm a sports fan, I'm a music fan and I'm a Star Trek fan. All\nof them.\nBut here's what I don't do. Tell me if any of this sounds familiar: \"Let's\nlist our\nten favorite episodes. Let's list our least favorite episodes. Let's list\nour favorite\ngalaxies. Let's make a chart to see how often our favorite galaxies appear\nin our\nfavorite episodes. What Romulan would you most like to see coupled with\na Cardassian\nand why? Let's spend a weekend talking about Romulans falling in love with\nCardassians\nand then let's do it again.\" That's not being a fan. That's having a\nfetish. And I don't\nhave a problem with that, except you can't bring your hobbies in to work, okay?\n\nJANICE\nGot it.\n\nJOSH\nExcept on Star Trek holidays. [exits]\n\nJANICE\nThere's no such thing as a Star Trek holiday.\n\nJOSH\nWell, work hard around here. We'll make one.\n\nJosh walks off, and Janice smiles.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT\nToby is sitting in the Mess alone. He's trying to write a speech, but is\nhaving trouble.\n\nTOBY\n...not just a chance, but a mission unique in all of human... To prove that\nliberty is...\nTo prove that... Freedom unlocks... a higher fraction of the human\npotential... than...\nthan any...\n\nWill walks up and tosses the pad in front of Toby.\n\nWILL\n498. But with my name, it's 500.\n\nTOBY\nThis is mine.\n\nToby hands Will the speech he's working on. They both start to read each\nother's speech\nsilently.\n\nTOBY\nStop reading mine.\n\nWILL\nActually it's...\n\nTOBY\nStop reading it, please.\n\nWill puts down Toby's speech, while Toby continues to read Will's.\n\nTOBY\nWe can't offer you any money. We could put you in a hotel.\n\nWILL\nI work with someone. She's my stepsister, actually.\n\nTOBY\nFine, but she's on your payroll.\n\nToby continues to read Will's speech.\n\nTOBY\nThis is incredibly good, Will. \"Never shrinking from the world's...\" \"...a\nfierce\nbelief in what we can achieve together.\" I used to write like this. It was\nten months\nago. I don't understand what's going on. I really don't. I've had slumps\nbefore.\nEverybody does, but this is different. I'm sorry, we don't know each other,\nbut there\naren't that many people I can talk to about it. I don't understand what's\nhappening.\nThere's no blood going to it. I never had to locate it before. I don't even\nknow where\nto look. I'm the President's voice and I don't want it to sound like\nthis. And there's\nan incredible history to second inaugurals. \"Fear itself,\" Lincoln... I\nreally thought\nI was on my way to being one of those guys. I thought I was close. Now I'm\njust writing\nfor my life and you can't serve the President that way. But if I didn't\nwrite... I can't\nserve him at all.\n\nWILL\nYeah. Can I tell you three things? You are more in need of a night in\nAtlantic City,\nthan any man I've ever met. Number two is, the last thing you need to worry\nabout is\nno blood going there. You've got blood going there, about thirteen ways. And\nsome of\nit isn't good. Once again, I say, \"Atlantic City.\" I'd say sit down at a\ntable, go for\ndinner, see a show, take a walk on the boardwalk and smell the salt air... but\nif you're\nanything like me, nothing after \"sit down at a table\" is going to happen.\n\nTOBY\nWhat's the third thing?\n\nWILL\nYou are one of those guys. This is an inning of good relief pitching from\na fresh arm.\n\nTOBY\nAll right. All right. Chances are you have certain qualities that are gonna\nannoy me.\nI don't know what they are yet, but you have a certain quality about you\nthat says that\neven though you're a capitalist, you've been schooled in Eastern philosophies.\n\nWILL\nI told you to go to Atlantic City.\n\nTOBY\nYou didn't deny you've been schooled in Eastern philosophy.\n\nWILL\nWell-schooled. You want me to locate your chakra?\n\nTOBY\nLook...\n\nWILL\nI'm a lawyer.\n\nTOBY\nGood, 'cause they're never annoying.\n\nWILL\nOkay. I'm glad you liked what I wrote. I'm prety tired. I've been tired for\na plenty\nlong time and you've been tired even longer. I'm getting on a plane tonight\nand going\nto a place in Nice and I'm going to stay there for a few weeks. When I get\nback, it'd\nbe a privelege to give you all the help you ask for.\n\nTOBY\nWell, I appreciate that.\n\nWILL\n[stands] Oh. man, I forgot. Sam wanted me to give you this.\n\nWill hands Toby the note from Sam.\n\nTOBY\nYou didn't give it to me yesterday?\n\nWILL\nYeah, you know what? Not your FedEx guy. Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nTOBY\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nWill leaves.

Nor us anymore, for that matter. One-third of all math teachers\nand half\nof science teachers didn't major or minor in that subject.\n\nSTANLEY\nI did very well in math and science. I don't know why.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd we'll want to get to the bottom of that. But we're increasing education\nspending to\nover a $100 billion a year and, as a result, we have seventh grade textbooks\nbeing used\nin ninth grade and the same answers get a higher score on S.A.T.s.\n\nSTANLEY\nThat pissed me off.\n\nBARTLET\nRight. But I'm talking about children now.\n\nSTANLEY\nWhat'd you get?\n\nBARTLET\nOn the S.A.T.s?\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nYou don't want to know.\n\nSTANLEY\nYou got double-800, didn't you?\n\nBARTLET\nI got 800/790. For the life of me, I can't imagine what I got wrong. Then\nI took them\nagain, and got 800/790. I mean, is it possible there was some sort of\nnumber-two pencil\nanomaly that could've...?\n\nSTANLEY\nExcuse me. I-I'm sorry to interrupt, uh... You got a 800/790 and took the\ntest again?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, I know, it's a little... something.\n\nSTANLEY\nIt's a little something. Yeah.\n\nBARTLET\nSo our schools have reached a crisis and our infant mortality rate is two\nand a half\ntimes what it is in Singapore. So what I think we should do for starters is,\nwe should\nkeep more people alive, then send them to school. Get a little peace and\nprosperity going.\n\nSTANLEY\nYou feeling like you haven't been doing enough about it yet?\n\nBARTLET\nStanley, the width and depth of what I haven't done about it yet... You know\nyou can't\ndo anything about hurricanes? The President can't do anything about nature\nor bad luck.\nI ought to be able to do something about the airplane.\n\nSTANLEY\nUh-oh.\n\nBARTLET\nWait, what'd I just say?\n\nSTANLEY\nIt's hard to figure, sir, but you've introduced a new word into the\nconversation.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do airplanes signify?\n\nSTANLEY\nDeath.\n\nBARTLET\nReally.\n\nSTANLEY\nWell, that's in dreams... I think. I don't know.\n\nBARTLET\nStanley, I never thought to ask, but you are a doctor, right?\n\nSTANLEY\nMe?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nSTANLEY\nHow do you mean?\n\nThey chuckle.\n\nBARTLET\nI've been spacing out for a minute at meetings. Three times this week. I\nhear someone\ntalking and realize I wasn't listening to part of it.\n\nSTANLEY\nThat's unusual?\n\nBARTLET\nVery.\n\nThe intercom rings and Bartlet answers.\n\nBARTLET\nHi. Yeah. [hangs up phone] It's Leo.\n\nLeo enters.\n\nLEO\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEO\nThe Church of the Nativity is closed. You want to believe that?\n\nBARTLET\nWhy?\n\nLEO\nI'm finding out. Dr. Keyworth, Dulles and International are both closed.\n\nSTANLEY\nAh.\n\nLEO\nYou mind being our guest for a little while?\n\nSTANLEY\nThank you.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd now we're one-third of the way through an Agatha Chrstie story. [gravely]\n\"Where\nnobody be goin' nowhere. The bridge is washed out.\" Well, I'm finished. But\nI was doing\nthe guy that says that in the Agatha Christie stories. Stanley, as always. Leo,\nI'll be\nin the office.\n\nLEO\nThank you, sir.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY\nCharlie is walking down the hallway flipping through a folder.

Uh, this is Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul, this is Charlie Young.\n\nCHARLIE\nHow do you do.\n\nJEAN-PAUL\nAh, Zoey talks about you all the time. She talks about you so much I think\nsometimes\nI want to kill you.\n\nCHARLIE\nHey, that's nice of you. Thanks.\n\nZOEY\nIt's a common emotion.\n\nCHARLIE\nIs there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?\n\nJEAN-PAUL\nNo, don't be silly.\n\nZOEY\nHe's very casual about it. The average passerby would never know he was\nFrench royalty.\nUnless, you know, they looked at him.\n\nJEAN-PAUL\nYes.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, Jean Paul, I read 150 words about you in US Weekly and I feel like I\nknow you already.\n\nJEAN-PAUL\nThank you.\n\nCHARLIE\nExcuse me.\n\nCharlie enters THE OVAL OFFICE and Zoey follows him, leaving Jean Paul in\nthe Outer Office.\n\nZOEY\nSo... I need you to give me the coverage on my father's mood.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhy?\n\nZOEY\n'Cause I want to ask him something.\n\nCHARLIE\nWhat?\n\nZOEY\nDo you need to know?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo, I just want to.\n\nZOEY\nIf I tell you why, will you tell me his mood?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes.\n\nZOEY\nI want to ask my dad if Jean-Paul can come to New Hampshire with us.\n\nCHARLIE\nHe hasn't met him yet.\n\nZOEY\nHe's going to meet him today.\n\nCHARLIE\nNow we've got ourselves a show.\n\nZOEY\nMy dad's going to love him.\n\nCHARLIE\nOh, yeah.\n\nZOEY\nWell, I love him, so my father will love him.\n\nCHARLIE\nThat's absolutely the way it works.\n\nZOEY\nWill you just tell me his mood?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo. I'm afraid you fell for the oldest trick in the book. I work for the\nPresident.\nI don't discuss his mood. But I wish you all the luck in the world. I like\nJean-Paul.\nYou've got a lot in common.\n\nZOEY\nYou are the worst kind of snob.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, I think there are snobs who are way worse but thank you.\n\nCharlie walks out of the Oval Office and passes Jean-Paul.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nDANNY\nWhen I left, they had 97 runs.\n\nC.J.\nThe score gets that high?\n\nDANNY\nA high score is 400.\n\nC.J.\nWhen did you start liking cricket?\n\nDANNY\nWell, I haven't yet. But last week I took four days in Bermuda.\n\nC.J.\nOh, I love Bermuda. I like the scooters.\n\nDANNY\nI do too, and I got one, and I was riding into Hamilton when I saw a bunch\nof people\nplaying cricket. And I like sports, though it turns out, not as much as\nI'd thought.\nBut that's not the point.\n\nC.J.\nWhat was the point?\n\nDANNY\nI met a guy there, a Bermudian whose name I'm not going to tell you right\nnow. He was\nexplaining the game to me. He's a cricket nut. He plays in a league. And\nhe's a ramp\nsignal agent at a small airstrip. He marshals planes as they're coming\nin. He was\ntelling me a story to illustrate how much he loves cricket. There was a day his\nsupervisor told his four-person crew they had tomorrow off 'cause a training\ncrew was\ncoming in to work their shift. Well, the next day, the guy realized that he\nleft his\ncricket bat in his locker at work and his wife had the car so he walks\nsix-miles back\nto the airstrip to get it. Except, when he got there, he wasn't allowed\nin. Three men\nin coveralls, who identified themselves as being part of the training crew,\nwere\nstanding out front. All three of them were white, two of them had Southern\naccents.\nOn May 21st, he was told to take tomorrow off. On the 22nd... Abdul Shareef's\nplane\nwent off radar 85 miles from Bermuda.\n\nC.J.\nThis is like something you'd get on the Internet.\n\nDANNY\nI'm back and I'm happy about it. And I think you know how I feel about\nyou. But don't\nmess me around on this story, okay? The three guys out front were U.S. Army\nRangers.\nI got to change my clothes.\n\nDanny walks out of C.J.'s office. C.J. watches him as he leaves.\n\nCAROL [OS]\nHe's back!\n\nDANNY [OS]\nI go where you are, Carol. You're where the story is.\n\nCUT TO: INT.

Leo, there are like 93,000\nother churches\nwithin rock-throwing distance of this place. I'm not sure...\n\nLEO\nI don't think that's the point. I'm not trying to create a plan for a\nlasting cease-fire.\nRight now, I'm just trying to fix a roof. Is that really not possible down\nthere? See\nif you can find a U.N. relief and recovery unit anywhere around there,\nor an NGO that\ncould serve as neutral-- God-- as a nuetral part to oversee transportation,\nstorage\nand repair. Thank you.\n\nJOSH\nThank you.\n\nJosh exits Leo's office into the HALLWAY.\n\nTOBY\nWhat the hell are you doing? What were you doing?\n\nJOSH\nYes, I'm sorry.

I want to talk about the notes.\n\nTOBY\nI agree with all three of them.\n\nWILL\nI agree with two of the three. He says: \"No leading with reform. Fix the\npipes. Don't\nbuy a new toolbox.\" You got to talk about the toolbox now. At the beginning\nof the\nadministration is the only time you can.\n\nTOBY\nExcept, if you say, at the beginning of the administration that you want\ncampaign reform,\nand nothing happens, then you just spent four years doing nothing about\ncampaign reform.\n\nWILL\nYeah, you got to get on the field and then you got to win.\n\nTOBY\nI-I still think he's right but it gets a conversation. Someone will tell\nyou what time\nthe meeting is.\n\nWILL\nWith who?\n\nTOBY\nThe President.\n\nWILL\nAnd who?\n\nTOBY\nUs.\n\nWILL\nUh, no. I shouldn't be there for that.\n\nTOBY\nYou can tell 'em I said move the bicycles, you know?\n\nWILL\nCan we forget about that? I'm not prepared, nor I must say, do I feel\ncomfortable at\nthis point--\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nToby walks out of Sam's office back into his OFFICE where his father is\nstill waiting.\n\nTOBY\nWe're striking out on hotels.\n\nJULIE\nWell, if you like, I can wait someplace else around here.\n\nTOBY\nOkay, that's a good idea. You've been convicted of multiple felonies. You\nthink the\nU.S. Secret Service lets you walk around this building unescourted?! You can't!\nYou're a threat to the President!\n\nJULIE\nI'm really not.\n\nTOBY\nI'm going to work for a while now.\n\nToby seats at his desk and begins to read papers.

Come inside.\n\nZOEY\nDad, no...\n\nBARTLET\nCome inside.\n\nThey enter THE OVAL OFFICE where Leo is sitting in a chair waiting.\n\nLEO\nGood evening, Mr. President. Zoey.\n\nZOEY\nHi, Mr. McGarry. Dad...\n\nBARTLET\nYou know, why don't you go back to the Residence and make sure your mom\nhasn't killed\nyour boyfriend. Yeah, he can come to Manchester. He's going to have more\nSecret Service\nstuff to do, and he's going to have to sleep in the root cellar which,\nlike your bedroom\ndoor, will be guarded round the clock by two U.S. Marshals.\n\nZOEY\nOkay. [leaves]\n\nLEO\nShe looks great.\n\nBARTLET\nI almost told her. I've been feeling it a little lately. I've been exorcising\nmy guilt\nby having Josh crowbar infant mortality money into the HHS budget on December\n23 at 8:00.\n\nLEO\nFor me, he's trying to get Arabs and Israelis to like each other.\n\nBARTLET\nHow's it going?\n\nLEO\nIt's a challenge.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah.\n\nLEO\nDanny Concannon knows a guy who couldn't get to his locker.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. We'll figure it out.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nStanley thought it was weird that I took the SAT's again, too.\n\nLEO\nIt is.\n\nBARTLET\nYou don't think it's possible that the remaining answer was important?\n\nLEO\nNo.\n\nBARTLET\nReally?\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nHow the hell would you know? You got 1400.\n\nLEO\nTrue.\n\nThere's a knock on the door.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir?\n\nBARTLET\nYeah, send them in.\n\nToby and Will enter the Oval Office.\n\nTOBY\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nYeah. Listen, my reasons for not wanting to talk about campaign reform at the\nInauguration are simple. It's not a legislative speech and when we cite issues,\nit should be the ones that affect people's lives. You agree?\n\nTOBY\nYes.\n\nBARTLET\nAnything else?\n\nToby turns to Will to see if he'll say anything.\n\nTOBY\nNo, sir. In his defense, he caught the bad note. He came to me. He made\nit important.\n\nLEO\nYeah.\n\nTOBY\nHe wasn't distracted bt the fact that his office was filled with bicycles.\n\nWILL\nExcuse me?\n\nTOBY\nYeah.\n\nWILL\nYou said that I caught the bad note?\n\nTOBY\nYeah, that was planted there to see how well you'd do telling truth to power.\n\nBARTLET\nNot very well so far.\n\nWILL\nI have no difficulty telling, sir, telling truth to power.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay, except when I asked you to come into the Oval Office you said, \"No,\nno, no.\nNo, no, no, no.\"\n\nWILL\nAnd I was firm in my convictions.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd you called me Mr. Justice.\n\nLEO\nCan we get back to why you think...?\n\nWILL\nBecause, yes, you do want to talk about issues that affect people. This is\nthe issue\nthat affects everyone and you can't get elected three times and you can't\nraise the\nsubject halfway throught a term.\n\nLEO\nMaybe, but I'm not convinced and that's 'caused you haven't convinced\nme. This isn't\nTillman at the Stanford Club or the California 47th. This is big-boy school,\nMr. Bailey.\nYou understand?\n\nWILL\nYes, sir. I do.\n\nLEO\nAll right. It's Christmas. You've probably got someplace to go.\n\nTOBY\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nToby exits the Oval Office to the HALLWAY. Josh is waiting for him.\n\nJOSH\nI just need to tell you this.

It wasn't out of a desire to do evil. He had\na young\nfamily and he barely spoke the language. He went to jail. He went to jail\nand you went\nto school, and it was all a half century ago. Look what he did in two\ngenerations.\nWhat room did you just walk out of?\n\nTOBY\nI appreciate that that's what you think. Do I get to think what I think?\n\nJOSH\nNo, you don't, 'cause you don't know what I know.\n\nTOBY\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nThat I would give anything to have a father who was a felon, or a sister\nwith a past.\nThat's it.\n\nJosh exits and is walking past Leo's office when Leo calls him out.\n\nLEO\nJosh! I was just coming to see you. You're off the hook with both of us. We'll\ngo for\ninfant mortality after the first.\n\nJOSH\nI don't mind. People are working on it. I have Donna here with me. We've\ngot a whole\nnight planned around it.\n\nLEO\nYeah, I'm calling it off, and I hooked Donna up with a news helicopter\nthat's landing\nabout two miles from the inn she's going to.\n\nJOSH\nDonna left?\n\nLEO\nYeah. Oh, forget the Nativity. We'll get 'em next time.\n\nJOSH\nYes, sir.\n\nCUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nJULIE\nYou know, I think it might make it easier if you knew some of the history.

She can't say no to the President if he asks her.\n\nDONNA\nHave you seen how foreign aid polls in Georgia?\n\nJOSH\nThere's a hockey coach who's got a player who's squandering his\npotential. Coach\nsays, \"Are you ignorant or just apathetic?\" Player says, \"I don't know and\nI don't\ncare.\" Yeah, I've seen how foreign aid polls in Georgia. Gracie might be\na little\ntough to get to the phone today.\n\nDONNA\nWe've been here before.\n\nJOSH\nTell me about it.\n\nDONNA\nYou had two different strategies that were shouted down. You can't take\nthe fall\nfor this.\n\nJOSH\nMy job is to execute the plays Leo calls.

You guys didn't come in here to tell me something funny?\n\nTOBY\nThree of us did.\n\nBARTLET\n[pointing at Josh] You... you, are the wildcard, my friend, because you...\n\nJOSH\nSir...\n\nBARTLET\n...because you will throw out the baby, the bathwater, and the bubbles\nat curtain\ntime if it means...\n\nJOSH\nExcuse me, sir...\n\nBARTLET\nFeel free to interrupt.\n\nJOSH\nDo you think, Mr. President, the people who get this money care about an\nNIH study?\n\nBARTLET\nI don't care if they care! I care! And oh, by the way, so do you!\n\nJOSH\n$115,000 is what Commerce spends on Post-Its.\n\nBARTLET\nToby?\n\nTOBY\nThreats to civil liberties only ever come a few dollars at a time.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a medical study. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty doesn't prohibit radiation\ntherapy.\nSufi Muslims, Orthodox Jews, Indian shamans-- the study says it works with\neverybody,\nso it's not promoting Christianity.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, in my faith, we've known it's worked for two thousand years. I never\nknew there\nwas data available, but okay.\n\nLEO\nAnything else, sir?\n\nBARTLET\nNo.\n\nALL\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nJOSH\nThank you, sir.\n\nThey all begin to exit.\n\nBARTLET\nMaxine.\n\nC.J.\n[to Josh] That's you.\n\nJOSH\nI know.\n\nLeo, C.J., and Toby leave.\n\nJOSH\nI apologize for interrupting before.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, I don't care. But what I was going to say...\n\nJOSH\n[passionately] I'll toss it all overboard if it means winning, and I think\nthat's\nnot true, and I'd ask you to support that with evidence... I'm sorry. I\ndon't know\nwhy I keep doing that.\n\nBARTLET\nYou're not willing to toss it overboard to win. You're willing to toss\nit overboard\nto avoid disappointing Leo. You know what the difference is between you and me?\nI want to be the guy. You want to be the guy the guy counts on.\n\nJOSH\nWe lost.\n\nBARTLET\nWe know.\n\nJOSH\nWe can introduce another continuing resolution... 90 days?\n\nBARTLET\nAnd work down?\n\nJOSH\n75% of current funding maybe.\n\nBARTLET\nIf we can get it.\n\nJOSH\nYou understand if we introduce another continuing resolution, about ten\nDemocrats\nwill jump on as a reason to vote no on this. Means losing 60-40 instead\nof 51-49.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen I lose, I don't look for consolation in the score and I know for sure\nyou don't.\nSo, it's what we should do, right?\n\nJOSH\nYeah.\n\nBARTLET\nAll right, tough beat. It's an unbelievably tough beat.\n\nJOSH\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nHey, Zoey's growing up very nicely, isn't she?\n\nJOSH\nMan, I'll say.\n\nBartlet gives a Josh a disapproving look.\n\nJOSH\nYou know, I go for kiss-ass today and the ball goes in the gutter.\n\nBARTLET\nAnything else?\n\nJOSH\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nJosh exits.\n\nCUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nDonna is sitting in a chair waiting for Josh to come out.\n\nDONNA\nI said the names.\n\nJOSH\nI don't think it mattered. She knows how to count to 51.\n\nDONNA\nIt would've loosened things up for an hour. I'm sorry.\n\nJOSH\nShake it off. And don't listen to the naysayer. You've got a big future as\na stalker.\n\nDONNA\nI always felt like I had the makings.\n\nJOSH\nI just had an interesting moment. I just recommended to the President that\nhe buy a\nyea vote for a $115,000 and the Bill of Rights.\n\nDONNA\nDon't you mean a $115 million?\n\nJOSH\nJimmy Hoebuck wanted to fund a study on remote prayer for $115,000.\n\nDONNA\nIs it me or is this getting harder?\n\nJOSH\nIt's getting harder. I'd say we're going to make more enemies in the second\nterm,\nbut I don't know if there's anybody left on the list.\n\nDONNA\nYou took funding for remote prayer to the President?\n\nThey chuckle.\n\nJOSH\nI did it with gusto.\n\nDONNA\nThat's 'cause you don't know the story of Fishhooks McCarty.\n\nJOSH\nIs this a real person or a Donna person?\n\nDONNA\nCorrupt politician on the Lower East Side in the '20s. Every morning he\nstopped at\nthe St. James Church on Oliver Street and said the same prayer, \"O Lord,\ngive me\nhealth and strength. We'll steal the rest.\"\n\nJOSH\nNot that there needs to be, but... was there a point?\n\nDONNA\nYou've got health and strength, both of which, coincidentally, I prayed\nfor after\nhot lead was shot into your body.\n\nJOSH\nYeah... You're going to need some Kryptonite, by the way.\n\nDONNA\nOkay, settle down.\n\nJOSH\nAll right.\n\nDONNA\nSo you've got health and strength.\n\nJOSH\nAnd we'll steal the rest?\n\nDONNA\nBet your ass.\n\nJOSH\nAll right. Good work tonight.\n\nJosh walks into the HALLWAY where he runs into Will.\n\nWILL\nHi.\n\nJOSH\nWhat's up, Mr. Daley?\n\nWILL\nBailey.\n\nJOSH\nBill Bailey?\n\nWILL\nWill Bailey.\n\nJOSH\nSo, if we're lucky, foreign aid's going to be funded for another 90 days at\n75 cents\non the dollar. No one who's ever said they wanted bipartisanship has ever\nmeant it.\nBut the people are speaking. Because 68% think we give too much in foreign\naid, and\n59% think it should be cut.\n\nWILL\nYou like that stat?\n\nJOSH\nI do.\n\nWILL\nWhy?\n\nThey reach JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.\n\nJOSH\nBecause 9% think it's too high, and shouldn't be cut! 9% of respondents\ncould not fully\nget their arms around the question. There should be another box you can\ncheck for, \"I\nhave utterly no idea what you're talking about. Please, God, don't ask for\nmy input.\"\n\nWILL\nWhy is foreign aid important?\n\nJOSH\nIt fosters democracy.\n\nWILL\nThere you go.\n\nJOSH\n[in British accent] Well, well played, young man. Very good, yes, yes.\n\nWILL\nI don't know if you realized, but for a second there, you changed voices.\n\nJOSH\nSomeone said, \"The best argument against democracy is five minutes with\nthe average\nvoter.\"\n\nWILL\nChurchill. He also said \"Democracy is the worst form of government.\"\n\nJOSH\nSee.\n\nWILL\n\"Except for all the others.\"\n\nJOSH\nI know the end of the quote. I'll work with you on the legislative section. But\nafter the vote, okay? We'll get some food.\n\nWILL\nYes. Excuse me, please.\n\nWill sees C.J. standing in the LOBBY talking to Carol. Carol walks off as Will\napproaches.\n\nWILL\nExcuse me.\n\nC.J.\nYes?\n\nWILL\nI believe you put a goat in my office, and I just want you to know that I\nstand here\nwith full humor and total focus.\n\nC.J. starts walking toward him, so he starts walking backwards towards the\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nOFFICE as he talks to her.\n\nWILL\nYou can fill my office with bicycles, you can cover the windows with\n\"Seaborn for\nCongress\" posters, you can bring in 101 Dalmatians. I'm focused on what\nI'm doing.\n\nC.J.\nWho are you?\n\nWILL\nI'm Will Bailey.\n\nC.J.\nC.J. Cregg.\n\nWILL\nVery nice to meet you.\n\nC.J.\nI didn't put the goat in your office. Someone else must have.\n\nWILL\nYou didn't?\n\nC.J.\nI put it in the office that's being used by a new guy Toby and Josh are\ntrying to\ngive a hard time to-- Oh, wait...\n\nWILL\nYou understand I'm working on the Inaugural address, right?\n\nC.J.\nHow's that going?\n\nWILL\nThere's bicycles and goats in my office! All right... Any care and feeding\nI should\nknow about?\n\nC.J.\nThe goat has a handler. I'll get it out...\n\nWILL\nNo! I'll take my hazing like the Eaton valedictorian that I am. What's his\nname, please?\n\nC.J.\nWhich one?\n\nWILL\nThe handler.\n\nC.J.\nMike.\n\nWILL\nThe goat has a name?\n\nC.J.\nRon.\n\nWILL\nThank you.\n\nC.J. smiles as he walks away then turns around to go in her office.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nPRESIDING OFFICER [VO]\nTwo minutes till quorum call.\n\nCUT TO: INT.\nDonna is sitting down when Ellen walks into the room.\n\nDONNA\nWhere do you learn to run out the clock like that?\n\nELLEN\nThe Senator's voting her conscience, Donna.\n\nDONNA\nShe understands foreign aid. I've heard her talk about it. She's supposed to do\nwhat's right.\n\nELLEN\nNo, she was elected and she's suppose to do what the people think is right.\n\nDONNA\n[holding out her cellphone] Will you take this and walk it to her on the floor?\nThat's all you have to do.\n\nEllen looks at the phone then takes it from Donna's hand when...\n\nPRESIDING OFFICER [VO]\nAll time has expired. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n\nELLEN\nWin some, you lose some.\n\nDONNA\nCan I tell you something? Josh has asked me to work Saturdays, work Sundays,\nand at\nleast once a week he has me there after 1:00 AM. He's asked me to transpose\nportions\nof the federal budget into base-8, go to North Dakota and dress as an\nEast German\ncocktail waitress. In five years of working for him, he's never asked me to\nhide him\nfrom something. Can I have my boss's phone back?\n\nDonna takes the phone out of Ellen's hand, then walks off.\n\nCUT TO: INT. WEST WING PRESS AREA - NIGHT\nC.J. and Danny are having Chinese food while watching the vote on TV.\n\nDANNY\nYou having that?\n\nC.J.\nYes.\n\nDANNY\nAll of it?\n\nC.J.\nYes!\n\nDANNY\nWhat about this?\n\nC.J.\nYes!\n\nDANNY\nI'm pointing at twenty-three packets of soy sauce!\n\nC.J.\nI give them to the homeless.\n\nDANNY\nThat's helpful.\n\nC.J.\nAre you talking through the whole vote?\n\nDANNY\nYou're going to lose this one 60-40.\n\nC.J.\nDanny...\n\nDANNY\nDid I ruin the end?\n\nC.J.\nCould you even have this much sensitivity? [making a little space with\nher chopsticks]\n\nDANNY\nNo.\n\nC.J.\nWhy?\n\nDANNY\n'Cause you blew it.\n\nC.J.\nThe Senate blew it.\n\nDANNY\nYou did.\n\nC.J.\nWe did everything but pass a hat!\n\nDANNY\nNobody wants to put money in a hat in Botswana when you got hats that need\nfilling here.\nYou can't make this about charity. It's about self-interest. We cut farm\nassistance in\nColombia. Every single crop we developed was replaced with cocaine. We cut\naid for\nprimary education in northwest Pakistan and Egypt; the kids went to\nmadrassahs. Why\nweren't you making a case that Republican senators are bad on drugs, and\nbad on national\nsecurity? Why are Democrats always so bumfuzzled? By the way, 65 more\nflight schools\ntoday. Maisy hasn't found your guy. Don't worry. There are thousands more.\n\nC.J.\nYou know something there, General Cho? If you had a story, you'd write it. If\nyou don't\nhave one, shut up.\n\nShe shoves an egg roll in his mouth.\n\nC.J.\nWe just lost a vote. We're not bumfuzzled. Now if you'll excuse me, I have\nto cancel a\nphoto op with a goat.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT\nToby, Josh, Will, Leo, and staffers are watching the vote on a TV and\nBartlet enters.\n\nBARTLET\nTough beat, everybody. Thanks for the work. Next time, we let Josh do it\nthe way he wants.\n\nJOSH\nSir, have you met...\n\nBARTLET\nBill Haley?\n\nWILL\nWill Bailey.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nGood evening, Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen's this thing with the cow?\n\nC.J.\nIt's a goat now.\n\nBARTLET\nOkay.\n\nC.J.\nWe'll cancel it.\n\nBARTLET\nYou think?\n\nC.J.\nA milking goat? It's going to seem like a parody of foreign aid.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't know. I don't know everybody. C.J. wants to cancel the goat\npicture. Half the\nworld's people live on less than two dollars a day. 130 million will never\nstep inside\na schoolhouse. Ingredients for bombs can be purchased at hardware stores\nand we've just\ngiven the Third World what the doctor ordered: rollbacks. Heifer\nInternational... they\ngive free cows and goats to people who need milk?\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, then, I don't think that we're in any position to be snotty. Let's\ndo it...\nLet's do it right now.\n\nC.J.\nCarol?\n\nCAROL\nThey're right out here.\n\nC.J.\nSo, I think this will work. I think it says, \"Well, you're impoverished and\nwhile we\ndon't care, we don't want you to go away empty-handed, so we offer you this\ngoat, Ron,\nto give you milk.\"\n\nRon and his handler Mike enter the Mural Room.\n\nWILL\nDo males goats give milk?\n\nC.J.\nNo, no, of course they don't. So, we offer you this thing that'll just gnaw\non your stuff.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm not standing in this picture alone. This was a total team failure. Stand\nwhere you\nwant, but I want my Chief of Staff and my Chief Political Advisor standing\nnear the goat.\n\nThey all gather around the goat to pose for the picture. The photographer\nis about to\ntake a picture but Toby stops him.\n\nTOBY\nHang on a second.\n\nToby walks over to a staffer that is not going to be in the picture.\n\nTOBY\nMay I?\n\nThe staffer nods.\n\nTOBY\nThank you.\n\nToby takes the security pass from around the staffers neck and slips it\naround Ron's.\nThey laugh.\n\nTOBY\nNow we're ready.\n\nBARTLET\nLet's go. [to Josh] Set that clock for 90 days.\n\nBartlet puts his arm around Josh and the photographer snaps the picture.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.\nFADE TO BLACK.\nTHE END\n* * *\n\nThe West Wing and all its characters are a property of Aaron Sorkin, John Wells\nProduction, Warner Brothers Television and NBC.
